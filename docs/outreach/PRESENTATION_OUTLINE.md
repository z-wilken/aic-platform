# presentation Outline: Information Regulator Meeting

**Duration:** 15 Minutes
**Objective:** Secure a "Letter of Support" or acknowledgment of AIC alignment with POPIA Section 71.

## 1. The Challenge: Meaningful Human Intervention (3 min)
*   **The Gap:** Section 71 prohibits "solely automated" decisions, but "meaningful intervention" is not yet technically defined in SA.
*   **The Risk:** Companies are currently guessing. This leads to inconsistent protection of data subjects and legal exposure for firms.
*   **The UW Study:** Highlight the 85.1% bias rate in resume screening as proof that intervention is often a "rubber stamp" without a framework.

## 2. The Solution: AI Integrity Certification (4 min)
*   **Third-Party Validation:** Moving from self-attestation to independent audit.
*   **The 3-Tier Framework:** 
    *   **Tier 1:** Mandatory approval.
    *   **Tier 2:** Real-time supervision.
    *   **Tier 3:** Periodic monitoring.
*   **The Integrity Score:** A quantitative 0-100 metric measuring accountability infrastructure.

## 3. Technical Rigor: The Audit Engine (3 min)
*   **Right to Empathy:** Analyzing automated communications for hostile/bureaucratic tone.
*   **Right to Explanation:** Technical validation of XAI (local feature importance).
*   **Bias Auditing:** Running Four-Fifths rule tests on datasets to identify disparate impact before it causes harm.

## 4. Benefit to the Regulator (3 min)
*   **Regulatory Efficiency:** AIC acts as a "pre-audit" layer. Certified companies provide the Regulator with standardized accountability reports.
*   **Standardization:** Establishing a benchmark for what "Section 71 Compliant" looks like in the private sector.
*   **Market Education:** AIC educates firms on their obligations, reducing the Regulator's enforcement burden.

## 5. The Proposal (2 min)
*   **Alpha Pilot Observation:** Invite the Regulator's technical team to observe an Alpha certification (anonymized).
*   **Letter of Acknowledgment:** Request a non-binding statement that the AIC framework aligns with the spirit of Section 71.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Offer to share anonymized findings from the Alpha Program to inform future IR guidance.
