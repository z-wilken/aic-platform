## Global / International Outreach Templates

*Use these templates for organizations outside South Africa or multinationals seeking global governance frameworks. Lead with the universal principle; map to their local regulation.*

---

### GLOBAL-1. LinkedIn Cold Outreach (The "Universal Principle" Hook)

**Target:** Chief Risk Officers, Head of Responsible AI, Head of Governance.

> **Subject:** Human accountability in [Company Name]'s automated decisions
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> When [Company Name]'s systems automatically reject a loan application, deny a job interview, or flag an insurance claim — is there a named human being accountable for that decision?
>
> Most organizations would say yes. But when pressed, the answer is usually "the algorithm."
>
> We've built **AIC (AI Integrity Certification)** — the global standard for certifying that human empathy and accountability remain in the loop for every consequential automated decision.
>
> Our framework maps to [EU AI Act / UK AI Guidelines / Title VII / your local regulation] and has been validated in South Africa, one of the world's most progressive automated decision-making regulatory environments.
>
> Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation about how other organizations in [industry] are approaching this?
>
> Best,
> Zander Wilken | AI Integrity Certification

### GLOBAL-2. Follow-up Email (The "Global Standard" Pitch)

**Target:** Follow-up after initial interest from international prospects.

> **Subject:** AIC: The global framework for human accountability in automated decisions
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> Great connecting. Here's what makes AIC different from ISO 42001, Big 4 consulting, or technical bias monitoring tools:
>
> **We certify the 5 Algorithmic Rights:**
> 1. Right to Human Agency — no final decision about a human made solely by a machine
> 2. Right to Explanation — every person knows why a decision was made
> 3. Right to Empathy — automated interactions preserve human dignity *(unique to AIC)*
> 4. Right to Correction — every system has a human-staffed appeal process
> 5. Right to Truth — people know when they're interacting with AI
>
> **Why this matters for [Company Name]:**
> - Maps to [EU AI Act / Title VII / your regulation]: AIC certification provides alignment evidence
> - No other framework certifies the Right to Empathy — whether your automated communications treat people as human beings
> - Accreditable under SANAS (South Africa) with international mutual recognition
>
> I'd love to share how [similar organization in their industry] is using AIC certification.
>
> Best,
> Zander

### GLOBAL-3. The "Empathy Hook" Template

**Target:** Organizations with high-volume automated rejection communications (lenders, insurers, recruiters, benefits administrators).

> **Subject:** Your AI rejection letters are destroying customer trust
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> Every day, [Company Name]'s automated systems send rejection letters, denial notices, and adverse action communications.
>
> These communications are often written by algorithms: cold, bureaucratic, legally defensive — the opposite of how a human would speak to another human facing difficult news.
>
> **This is a design failure. And it's measurable.**
>
> AIC's audit engine analyses the sentiment and empathy of automated communications — and certifies that your automated interactions preserve human dignity. We call it the **Right to Empathy**. No other certification body in the world measures this.
>
> Organizations that certify the Right to Empathy report:
> - Higher customer satisfaction scores on denied applications
> - Fewer formal complaints to regulators
> - Stronger brand trust metrics in vulnerable customer segments
>
> Can I send you our one-pager on the Right to Empathy audit?
>
> Best,
> Zander Wilken | AI Integrity Certification

## Universal Positioning (Use in any context)

**One-line pitch:** "AIC certifies that human empathy and accountability remain in the loop for every consequential automated decision."

**Three-line pitch:** "When algorithms make decisions that affect human lives, someone must be accountable. AIC certifies that the humans in your organization remain genuinely responsible — and empathetic — in your automated systems. We are the global standard. We started in South Africa because POPIA Section 71 is the world's most progressive human oversight law."
