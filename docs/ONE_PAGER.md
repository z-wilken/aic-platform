# AIC: AI Integrity Certification
**The Global Standard for Human Accountability in Automated Decisions**
*Starting in South Africa. Built for the world.*

## The Universal Problem

Every day, algorithms decide who gets hired and who is rejected. Who receives a loan and who is denied. Who gets medical treatment and who waits. Who is released on parole and who stays in prison.

When these systems fail — when they discriminate, exclude, or dehumanize — there is no one to answer for it. The algorithm made the decision. The company deployed it. The vendor built it. The data shaped it. Everyone is involved. **No one is accountable.**

This is not a technology problem. It is a human accountability problem.

## The 5 Algorithmic Rights

AIC's certification is built on five universal rights that apply to anyone affected by automated decisions — regardless of which country they live in or which regulation governs their industry:

1. **Right to Human Agency** — No final decision affecting dignity, freedom, or livelihood shall be made solely by a machine.
2. **Right to Explanation** — Every person has the right to know *why* a decision was made.
3. **Right to Empathy** — Automated interactions must preserve human dignity. Cold, bureaucratic algorithmic rejection is a design failure.
4. **Right to Correction** — Every system must provide a clear, human-staffed appeal mechanism.
5. **Right to Truth** — Every person has the right to know if they are interacting with AI.

*The Right to Empathy is AIC's unique contribution. No other standard certifies whether automated interactions preserve human dignity.*

## The Solution

AIC is a third-party certification body. We certify that **human empathy and accountability remain in the loop** for every consequential automated decision.

We don't just audit code. We certify the people, processes, and governance structures that ensure a human remains responsible for every consequential algorithmic outcome.

### The 3-Tier Framework

We match accountability requirements to the stakes of the decision:

*   **Tier 1: Human-Approved (Critical Risk)**
    *   *Usage:* Cancer diagnosis, parole decisions, major loans.
    *   *Requirement:* 100% human review before any decision takes effect.
*   **Tier 2: Human-Supervised (Elevated Risk)**
    *   *Usage:* Consumer credit, resume screening, insurance underwriting.
    *   *Requirement:* Real-time override capability + quarterly bias auditing.
*   **Tier 3: Automated-Permissible (Standard Risk)**
    *   *Usage:* Product recommendations, spam filtering.
    *   *Requirement:* Clear user disclosure + semi-annual monitoring.

## The South African Opportunity

**POPIA Section 71** — one of the most progressive automated decision-making laws in the world — prohibits algorithmic decisions without meaningful human intervention. This creates an immediate, legally-mandated market for AIC certification in South Africa.

AIC is using South Africa as the proving ground for a framework designed for global applicability. POPIA Section 71 is our market entry point, not our ceiling.

## Why AIC Certification?

1. **Regulatory Alignment:** Demonstration of POPIA Section 71 compliance — with a framework built to map to the EU AI Act, Title VII, and any future jurisdiction.
2. **Financial Incentive:** Working with major insurers to provide premium discounts for AIC-certified systems.
3. **Market Trust:** Prove to customers, partners, and regulators that your AI is overseen by accountable humans.
4. **Competitive Differentiation:** "AIC-Certified" signals that your organization treats the humans it affects with dignity — something no other certification body validates.
