**THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR CURRENT PITCH**

**Investors will ask:** \"You are asking for ZAR 10M to build something
that has never been sold. How do you know anyone will pay for this?\"

**The solution:** Run an Alpha Program to validate willingness-to-pay,
refine your methodology, and generate case studies BEFORE seeking
investment. This document outlines a 6-month validation roadmap that
costs \<ZAR 500K but de-risks the entire business.

**ALPHA PROGRAM OVERVIEW**

> **Vision Context:** The Alpha Program validates AIC's universal framework in the South African market, using POPIA Section 71 as the regulatory anchor. South Africa is the proving ground; the framework is built for the world. Every methodology refinement, case study, and unit economics data point produced in the Alpha Program feeds into a global certification standard.

**Program Objectives:**

-   • Validate pricing: Confirm organizations will pay ZAR 60K-120K for
    > AI accountability certification

-   • Refine methodology: Test Integrity Score framework on real
    > organizations with real AI systems

-   • Generate case studies: Document 5-10 certification processes with
    > measurable outcomes

-   • Build relationships: Establish partnerships with Information
    > Regulator, SANAS, insurance companies

-   • Prove traction: Show investors real revenue and letters of intent
    > from pilot participants

-   • Test messaging: Validate that \"human accountability\" positioning
    > resonates with decision-makers

**Program Structure:**

-   • Duration: 6 months (January - June 2026)

-   • Participants: 5-10 early-adopter organizations

-   • Pricing: 50% discount (ZAR 60K for small, ZAR 120K for medium)

-   • Deliverable: \"Alpha Certification\" (non-SANAS accredited, but
    > rigorous audit)

-   • Follow-up: Participants receive free upgrade to full
    > SANAS-accredited certification upon launch

-   • Requirements: Participants must allow publication of case studies
    > (anonymized if needed)

**6-MONTH VALIDATION TIMELINE**

**[MONTHS 1-2: Foundation & Recruitment]{.underline}**

> **Finalize Alpha Certification Framework:** Complete Integrity Score
> methodology, audit checklists, and certification requirements for all
> 3 tiers. Create audit training materials.
>
> **Recruit Pilot Participants:** Target: 20 outreach conversations → 10
> serious prospects → 5-7 signed participants. Focus on: (1) Banks using
> AI credit scoring, (2) Healthcare organizations using diagnostic AI,
> (3) Recruitment platforms with AI screening, (4) Insurance companies
> with underwriting AI.
>
> **Secure Institutional Support:** Letter of support from Information
> Regulator stating alignment with POPIA Section 71. Initial meeting
> with SANAS to discuss accreditation pathway. Partnership conversation
> with iTOO or Santam on insurance discount program.
>
> **Assemble Alpha Team:** Recruit 1-2 experienced ISO auditors as
> contract consultants (ZAR 8K/day, \~20 days total = ZAR 160K). Engage
> legal advisor on POPIA compliance (ZAR 50K). Technical AI specialist
> for bias testing (ZAR 80K).

**Month 1-2 Budget: ZAR 290K**

**[MONTHS 3-4: Alpha Audits]{.underline}**

> **Conduct Alpha Certifications:** Execute 5-10 full certification
> audits. Each audit includes: (1) Pre-audit documentation review, (2)
> 2-3 day on-site assessment, (3) Technical bias testing of AI systems,
> (4) Human oversight verification, (5) Certification decision and
> report delivery.
>
> **Document Process Learnings:** After each audit, document: What
> worked well? What took longer than expected? Which tier requirements
> needed clarification? What objections did auditors encounter? What
> evidence formats were most useful?
>
> **Refine Framework:** Update Integrity Score methodology based on
> real-world application. Adjust audit checklists and evidence
> requirements. Create industry-specific guidance (banking vs.
> healthcare vs. recruitment).
>
> **Collect Participant Feedback:** Post-audit surveys: (1) Was
> certification valuable? Why? (2) What would you pay for full
> SANAS-accredited version? (3) Would you recommend to peers? (4) What
> additional services would be useful (monitoring, training)?

**Month 3-4 Budget: ZAR 100K (auditor time, travel, testing tools)**

**Month 3-4 Revenue: ZAR 420K-600K (7 participants @ ZAR 60K-120K
each)**

**[MONTHS 5-6: Case Studies & Investment Readiness]{.underline}**

> (1) Organization profile and AI use cases, (2) Audit process and
> findings, (3) Corrective actions implemented, (4) Business value
> delivered (e.g., insurance discount, tender eligibility, risk
> mitigation). Include anonymized examples and 1-2 named references if
> possible.
>
> **Collect Letters of Intent:** From pilot participants: \"We commit to
> purchasing full SANAS-accredited certification upon availability.\"
> From prospective clients: \"We are interested in certification pending
> SANAS accreditation.\" Target: 15-20 LOIs representing ZAR 3-4M in
> pipeline revenue.
>
> **Submit SANAS Application:** With evidence from Alpha Program: (1)
> Demonstrated competence conducting audits, (2) Refined methodology and
> procedures, (3) Trained auditor team, (4) Quality management system
> documentation. Application fee: ZAR 9,300.
>
> **Prepare Investor Materials:** Update pitch deck with: (1) Alpha
> Program results, (2) Case studies, (3) Letters of intent, (4)

**Outreach Messaging:**

\"We are launching a pilot AI accountability certification program
aligned with POPIA Section 71. Early participants receive 50% discount
and help shape the certification standard that will become industry
requirement. Are you using AI in credit/hiring/diagnosis decisions? Can
I send you a one-pager?\"

**WHAT INVESTORS WANT TO SEE**

-   • (\'Proof of Payment\', \'Bank statements showing ZAR 420K+
    > received from Alpha participants. This is 100x more valuable than
    > a survey saying \"85% would be willing to pay.\"\')

-   • (\'Real Quotes from Customers\', \'\"AIC certification helped us
    > win a ZAR 15M government tender that required proof of ethical AI
    > use.\" - CFO, Tier 2 Bank (actual quote, not hypothetical)\')

-   • (\'Pipeline with Names\', \'List of 15-20 organizations with
    > contact details, organization size, expected certification value.
    > Not \"addressable market\" - actual conversations.\')

-   • (\'Regulatory Endorsement\', \'Letter from Information Regulator
    > on official letterhead. Even non-binding support letter carries
    > huge weight.\')

-   • (\'Refined Unit Economics\', \'Actual costs from Alpha Program:
    > \"Each audit took 4.2 days on average (not our initial estimate of
    > 3 days). COGS was ZAR 62K (vs. projected ZAR 44K). Margin was 58%
    > (still very healthy).\"\')

-   • (\'Team Proof\', \'Show that Lead Auditors delivered quality work.
    > Include their CVs and examples of audit reports they produced.\')

-   • (\'Case Studies with Numbers\', \'\"Discovery Health reduced AI
    > liability insurance premium by 18% after certification.\" -
    > Specific, measurable outcomes.\')

**BOTTOM LINE**

**Do NOT raise ZAR 10M on an untested concept.** Investors see 100
pitches per month from people with \"great ideas.\" You need to be the 1
in 100 who has actually sold the thing.

**The Alpha Program costs \<ZAR 500K and can be self-funded or
bootstrapped through initial consulting work. After 6 months, you will
have:**

-   • Real revenue (ZAR 420-600K)

-   • Paying customers willing to be references

-   • Refined methodology proven on real AI systems

-   • Case studies with measurable outcomes

-   • Pipeline of 15-20 organizations

-   • SANAS application submitted

-   • Regulatory relationships established

*At that point, raising ZAR 10M becomes easy. You are not asking
investors to believe in your vision - you are showing them proof that
the market wants what you built.*
