## 💡 Core Principle

> "We do not regulate AI. We certify that humans remain accountable."

AIC certifies **human accountability** in AI deployment — not the AI technology itself. When systems make decisions that affect human dignity, humans must remain accountable.

## 📊 Three-Tier Framework

| Tier | Name | Human Role | Example |
|------|------|------------|---------|
| **1** | Human-Approved | AI advises, human decides | Cancer treatment, parole decisions |
| **2** | Human-Supervised | AI executes, human oversees | Loan approvals, resume screening |
| **3** | Automated-Permissible | AI operates, periodic monitoring | Product recommendations, email filtering |

See [tier-framework.html](design/tier-framework.html) for visual representation.
