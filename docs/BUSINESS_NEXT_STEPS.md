This document outlines the regulatory roadmap and institutional registrations required to establish AIC as the definitive standard for AI accountability in South Africa.

## 1. Legal Adherence (The Regulatory Stack)

AIC must maintain strict compliance with, and provide interpretations for, the following laws:

### A. POPIA Section 71 (Core)
*   **Requirement:** Prohibition of automated decision-making that has a legal or substantial effect on a person.
*   **AIC Action:** Maintain a formal "Legal Interpretation Guide" for Section 71 to share with SANAS and the Information Regulator.

### B. Constitution of South Africa (Section 10)
*   **Requirement:** Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected.
*   **AIC Action:** Link "Algorithmic Rights" (especially Empathy and Agency) to Constitutional dignity.

### C. Consumer Protection Act (CPA)
*   **Requirement:** Right to fair, just, and reasonable terms and conditions.
*   **AIC Action:** Ensure AIC disclosure standards protect consumers from "Deceptive AI."

### D. Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA)
*   **Requirement:** Right to access information held by private/public bodies required for the exercise of rights.
*   **AIC Action:** Build AIC Pulse to facilitate PAIA requests regarding automated decisions.

## 2. Institutional Registrations & Accreditation

To transition from an Alpha program to a recognized authority, the following steps are mandatory:

### A. Information Regulator Engagement
*   **Objective:** Secure a formal letter of acknowledgment or a "Memorandum of Understanding" (MoU).
*   **Next Step:** Schedule a briefing session with the Regulator to present the AIC 3-Tier Framework.

### B. SANAS Accreditation (ISO/IEC 17021-1)
*   **Objective:** Become an accredited certification body.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Implement a Management System (Quality Manual).
    2.  Complete 5 "Witness Audits" (Alpha participants).
    3.  Submit formal application to SANAS.
    4.  Undergo assessment and clearance of non-conformances.
*   **Timeline:** 12-18 months.

### C. International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)
*   **Objective:** Corporate membership and professional training alignment.
*   **Next Step:** Register AIC as a corporate member.

## 3. Business Development Priorities (Month 1-6)

1.  **Insurance Pilot:** Finalize partnership with a South African insurer (e.g., Santam, iTOO) to offer premium discounts for AIC-certified entities.
2.  **Public Sector Outreach:** Engage the State Information Technology Agency (SITA) regarding the National AI Policy Framework.
3.  **Lead Auditor Training:** Develop the curriculum for the first 50 Lead Auditors to scale the business model.
