# Competitive Analysis — AIC Positioning
*February 24, 2026 | Review quarterly*
*Cross-references: [[10-STRATEGY]] | [[04-CERTIFICATION-FRAMEWORK]] | [[11-REVENUE-MODEL]] | [[00-INDEX]]*

> **The honest competitive landscape:** Nobody does exactly what AIC does. But buyers don't see it that way — they compare AIC to whatever they currently use to manage AI risk. The competitive threat is not that someone builds a better AIC. It is that clients decide to do nothing, or use Big 4 consultants, or check a POPIA compliance box and call it done.

## 1. Direct Competitors — AI Governance Certification

### Holistic AI (UK, founded 2018)

**What they do:** AI risk management platform. Assesses AI systems for bias, privacy, explainability, and robustness. Enterprise SaaS. Operates in UK and US primarily.

**Funding:** Series A, ~$15M raised.

**Strengths:**
- Technical depth — API-based model testing, not just document review
- EU AI Act compliance tools well-developed
- Enterprise sales infrastructure exists

**Weaknesses:**
- No human accountability / Right to Correction focus
- No empathy dimension
- UK/US-centric — no SA-specific POPIA mapping, no JSE context
- Expensive for SA market
- Platform-first, not institution-first — lacks the authority positioning

**AIC differentiation:** AIC's "certify humans, not machines" framing goes where Holistic AI doesn't. AIC certifies the accountability structure; Holistic AI tests the algorithm. These are complementary, not competing. **AIC should consider positioning Holistic AI as a technology partner, not a competitor.**

### Credo AI (US, founded 2020)

**What they do:** AI governance platform for enterprise. Policy creation, risk assessment, audit trails, compliance tracking. Strong NIST AI RMF integration.

**Funding:** Series B, ~$30M raised.

**Strengths:**
- Deep US regulatory mapping (NIST, EEOC, CCPA)
- Strong enterprise product and UX
- Well-funded, growing sales team

**Weaknesses:**
- US-regulatory-centric — zero African market presence
- No empathy or communication quality dimension
- Certification is self-assessed via their platform, not third-party verified
- No public standard or declaration — proprietary framework
- SaaS pricing not suited to SA/African SME market

**AIC differentiation:** The key difference is third-party verification vs self-assessment. Credo AI helps organisations manage their own AI governance. AIC independently certifies it. This is the difference between a company filing its own ESG report and having that report verified by an external auditor. Both have value; only one provides the credibility signal investors, regulators, and the public trust.

### ForHumanity (US/Global, founded 2017)

**What they do:** Independent audit and certification for AI systems. Operates globally. Publishes free audit frameworks, charges for accreditation.

**Status:** Non-profit structure. Developing ISO/IEC 42001 auditor accreditation.

**Strengths:**
- Genuinely independent (non-profit structure)
- ISO/IEC 42001 alignment is strong
- Global brand emerging in AI ethics space
- Free framework attracts academic and policy attention

**Weaknesses:**
- Non-profit model limits commercial agility and SA market focus
- No Africa presence, no POPIA mapping
- Methodology is technical and process-heavy — less accessible for SA SMEs
- Empathy and communication quality are absent from framework
- No equivalent to AIC's Governance Index (no public accountability mechanism)

**AIC differentiation:** ForHumanity is the closest global equivalent to what AIC is building. The competitive response is Africa-first specificity: POPIA, JSE, SA context, Empathy as a distinct right. AIC should monitor ForHumanity closely — if they expand to Africa, they become a genuine threat. The pre-emptive defence is moving fast, owning the SA certification body relationship, and making AIC the de facto SA standard before ForHumanity arrives.

---

### Responsible AI Institute (US, founded 2019)

**What they do:** Certification for AI systems, training programmes, standards development.

**Status:** Non-profit. Growing recognition in US enterprise market.

**Weakness vs AIC:** Same as ForHumanity — US-centric, no African operations, no POPIA focus, no empathy dimension.

## 2. Indirect Competitors — Adjacent Frameworks

### ISO/IEC 42001 — AI Management Systems Standard

**What it is:** The international standard for AI management systems, published 2023. Defines requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an AI management system.

**Why it matters to AIC:** ISO/IEC 42001 is increasingly referenced in EU AI Act compliance contexts. SA companies aware of the EU AI Act are asking "do we need ISO 42001?" rather than "do we need AIC?"

**The relationship AIC should pursue:**

AIC's 5 KPIs (used in the AI Governance Index) map directly to ISO/IEC 42001 clauses:

| AIC KPI | ISO/IEC 42001 Clause |
|---|---|
| Inventory & Classification | §6.1 — Risk assessment and identification |
| Policy Hit Rates | §8.4 — Operational controls |
| Human Override Rate | §8.5 — Human oversight |
| Audit Readiness | §9.1 — Monitoring, measurement, analysis, evaluation |
| Board Oversight | §5.1 — Leadership and commitment |

**AIC's positioning:** AIC is not a competitor to ISO 42001. AIC is what ISO 42001 means in the context of individual human rights — it translates the management systems language into rights-based accountability. An organisation can be ISO 42001 compliant but still violate Right 5 (Empathy) or Right 4 (Correction). AIC goes further. **"AIC-certified organisations meet and exceed ISO/IEC 42001 requirements on the dimensions that affect individual human rights."**

This should be a published white paper within 6 months.

### B Corp Certification (B Lab)

**What it is:** Social and environmental impact certification. Used by ~7,000 companies globally.

**Relevance to AIC:** B Corp is AIC's closest structural analogy. Free public standard → paid verification → third-party certification → public registry. This is exactly AIC's model.

**Lessons from B Corp:**

| B Corp Practice | AIC Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Free public Standards | Declaration of Algorithmic Rights (free, CC) |
| B Impact Assessment (self-reported) | SME self-assessment (paid, platform) |
| Third-party verification audit | Enterprise certification (auditor-led) |
| B Corp directory (public registry) | AIC public registry (Integrity Score) |
| Recertification every 3 years | AIC annual renewal |

**B Corp weaknesses AIC avoids:** B Corp certification process takes 12–18 months (too slow for Year 1 AIC). B Corp score threshold is 80/200 — a very low bar. AIC's provisional threshold (50/100) is relatively higher. B Corp has no AI-specific dimension.

**Sales positioning:** "Like B Corp, but for AI accountability. And faster." This framing lands immediately with sustainability-minded buyers who already understand B Corp.

### Big 4 — AI Governance Consulting (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG)

**What they offer:** AI ethics advisory, model risk management, POPIA compliance consulting, AI governance frameworks. No standard, no certification, no public registry.

**Strengths:**
- Existing enterprise relationships
- Brand credibility with boards and audit committees
- Resources to customise to any client requirement

**Weaknesses — and why AIC wins:**
- They build your governance programme. AIC certifies whether it works.
- Big 4 is paid to make you look good. AIC is paid to be honest.
- Big 4 AI governance reports are confidential. AIC's Integrity Score is public.
- Big 4 has no empathy dimension, no human rights framework, no public accountability mechanism.
- Big 4 charges ZAR 300K–1M for a POPIA compliance review. AIC charges ZAR 175K for certification.

**The strategic position:** Big 4 should be AIC's referral partners, not competitors. Deloitte runs the POPIA compliance programme; AIC certifies the outcome. Both win. AIC should proactively approach Big 4 to structure referral relationships where Big 4 recommends AIC certification as the capstone of their AI governance work.

**The risk:** Big 4 could launch their own certification product. This is the "big competitor enters market" scenario in [[AIC-Risk-Register]] R-08. The defence is speed and specificity — own the SA standard, the POPIA mapping, the Empathy right, before they can replicate it.

## 3. The "Do Nothing" Competitor

The most common competitor is the decision to do nothing. Most SA organisations:
- Are not currently under S71 enforcement pressure
- Have general POPIA compliance managed by legal teams
- See AI governance as a future concern, not a present one

**The "do nothing" answer to AIC's sales pitch:**
- *"We'll wait until there's enforcement."* → Counter: EU AI Act enforcement is now. Your EU-connected operations are already at risk.
- *"We have a POPIA compliance programme."* → Counter: POPIA compliance is not AI governance. S71 compliance requires specific AI-accountability infrastructure that most POPIA programmes don't include.
- *"We're not a JSE Top 40 company."* → Counter: The paid self-assessment is ZAR 10K. This is less than your legal team's monthly retainer.

**The urgency argument that works:** *"The AI Governance Index is public. Your competitors are on it. Your score is based on what we can see from the outside. You can either let us score you on public data, or you can get certified and tell your own story."*

## 5. AIC's Defensible Moat

Certification businesses are moat businesses. Once a standard is established, it is self-reinforcing:

1. **Declaration of Algorithmic Rights** — published under Creative Commons. If adopted by SA companies, academic institutions, or the Information Regulator as a reference standard, it becomes self-perpetuating.

2. **AI Governance Index** — the first mover who publishes the SA AI governance rankings owns that frame. If AIC publishes this before anyone else, "how does your company score on the AIC Index?" becomes the question every Board gets asked. No competitor can easily replicate a 2-year track record of data.

3. **Certified company network** — once 20+ companies are AIC-certified, they create mutual credibility. "We're AIC certified, are you?" becomes a B2B question in procurement.

4. **Methodology IP** — the Empathy Rubric, the 5 KPI scoring framework, and the Integrity Score calculation are proprietary. Competitors can build similar tools but not identical ones.

5. **Regulator relationship** — the first private-sector certification body to have a working relationship with the Information Regulator holds a position that is almost impossible to displace.
