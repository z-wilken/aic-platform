# Claude Skills — Full Capability Overview
*Last updated: February 24, 2026 | Auto-generated by Claude (Cowork mode)*

> **What are Skills?** Skills are specialised modules that extend Claude's capabilities beyond general conversation. Each skill contains domain-specific workflows, frameworks, and best practices refined through iteration. Invoke them by name in any session.

## How to Invoke a Skill

Simply describe what you need and Claude will trigger the relevant skill automatically, or you can call it directly:
- *"Review this contract"* → triggers `legal:contract-review`
- *"Build me a dashboard from this CSV"* → triggers `data:build-dashboard`
- *"Create a PowerPoint about X"* → triggers `anthropic-skills:pptx`
