# Revenue Architecture — Dual-Track Model

> AIC creates both the standard AND the certification simultaneously. Closer to Fair Trade Foundation or LEED than to ISO.

## The Dual-Track

### Track 1: The Standard (Creates Demand)

| Activity | Revenue | Real Value |
|----------|---------|------------|
| [[Declaration of Algorithmic Rights]] | Free / open | Market positioning, media, regulatory influence |
| [[AI Governance Index]] | Free / public | Pressure, data asset, media |
| Weekly content | Free | Authority, SEO, speaking invitations |
| White papers | Free | Academic credibility |
| Regulator engagement | Free | Policy influence, preferred partner |

None generates direct revenue. All create conditions for Track 2.

### Track 2: The Certification (Captures Demand)

| Product | Price | Margin | Scale |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Enterprise Cert (Tier 1-3) | ZAR 75K-500K | ~65% | Relationship sales |
| SME Self-Serve | ZAR 5K-15K | ~85% | Automated platform |
| Annual Renewal | 60% of initial | ~80% | Recurring |
| Partner Referrals | 10-20% of partner fee | 100% | Network effect |
| Auditor Training | ZAR 35K/trainee | ~70% | Scales with demand |

## The Moody's Model

Credit rating agencies don't just rate. They:
1. **Define methodology** → [[Declaration of Algorithmic Rights]]
2. **Educate market** → [[AI Governance Index]], content, conferences
3. **Lobby regulators** → Info Regulator, [[Procurement Clauses]]
4. **Charge for rating** → Certification revenue

Structural requirement: standard-setting must *feel* independent from commercial certification.

## What We Will NOT Do

| We Will Do | We Will NOT Do |
|------------|----------------|
| Audit empathy | Rewrite their communications |
| Assess POPIA compliance | Build their compliance programme |
| Test for bias | Retrain their models |
| Identify gaps | Implement fixes |
| Refer to partners | Take implementation contracts |

**The line:** We assess and certify. Never implement and certify same work. [[Strategy Session AIC Pivot#The Conflict of Interest Question|Arthur Andersen lesson]].
