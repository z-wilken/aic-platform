# Strategic Rethink — February 2026

## The Identity Question

*This is the most important question to answer before anything else gets built.*

**Is AIC a technology company, a professional services firm, or an institution?**

| Identity | What It Means | How It Scales | Risk |
|----------|--------------|---------------|------|
| Technology company | Build a platform. Self-serve assessments, automated scoring, dashboards. | Scales without headcount. Software margins. | Takes longer to build. Needs capital upfront. |
| Professional services firm | Send auditors into companies. Document reviews, bias testing, reports. | Scales linearly with headcount. Consulting margins. | Becomes another Deloitte. Hard to exit. |
| Institution | Set the standard. Publish research. Shape policy. Convene the community. | Scales through influence. Certification revenue funds operations. | Slow to monetise. Requires credibility first. |

**The recommended path:** Start as the institution, use technology to scale the certification, keep professional services as small as possible.

Year 1 = Become the authority. Year 2 = Automate the certification. Year 3 = Scale the platform.

## The Five Fears

### Fear 1: The Timing Paradox

POPIA Section 71 exists on paper but isn't being enforced. The Information Regulator is understaffed, underfunded, and hasn't issued a single Section 71 enforcement action. If enforcement takes another 3-4 years, we could burn through runway educating a market that doesn't feel urgency.

**The real question:** Can AIC survive financially until enforcement arrives?

**Possible mitigations:**
- EU AI Act creates global pressure regardless of SA enforcement
- [[AI Governance Index]] creates reputational pressure without regulation
- SME self-serve product (see [[Revenue Architecture]]) generates volume revenue without enforcement fear
- Insurance partnerships create incentive independent of regulatory enforcement

### Fear 2: The Empathy Word

The [[Declaration of Algorithmic Rights|Right to Empathy]] is AIC's genuine differentiator. But people writing cheques — CROs, CCOs — think in risk and liability, not empathy.

**Test this:** In first five sales conversations, try different framings:

| Framing | Predicted Reaction |
|---------|-------------------|
| "Empathy certification" | "Sounds nice but what's the ROI?" |
| "Human dignity assurance" | "Interesting but hard to measure" |
| "Communication quality certification" | "I can see how that works" |
| "Automated interaction standards" | "What does that actually cover?" |

### Fear 3: The Access Problem

No company is giving AIC full access to their AI infrastructure. See [[Evidence Collection Models]] for the four alternative approaches.

**Critical insight:** The [[What to Build Now#The Empathy Analysis Engine|Empathy Analysis Engine]] is the one capability that requires ZERO system access. Start here.

### Fear 4: The Methodology Is Untested

The [[Methodology]] has never been used on a real company. The first five certifications are R&D, not products. Expect to rewrite 30-50% after the first three engagements.

> **📝 My notes:**
> 

### Fear 5: Single Point of Failure

Building a standards body + technology platform + sales operation + regulatory engagement simultaneously = four full-time jobs.

**Do you need a co-founder?**

| Type | What They Bring |
|------|----------------|
| Technical CTO | Platform development, engine architecture |
| Regulatory/Legal | POPIA expertise, Regulator relationships, SANAS |
| Commercial/Sales | Enterprise relationships, banking/insurance network |

## The Five Opportunities

### Opportunity 1: [[AI Governance Index]] as Flagship Product

The Index might be more valuable than the certification business. Public rankings create market pressure, media coverage, authority, sales pipeline, and a compounding data asset.

**Consider making the Index the flagship and certification the monetisation behind it.**

> **📝 My notes:**

### Opportunity 2: SME Self-Serve Product

~150 large SA companies deploy consequential AI. Thousands of SMEs use automated tools off the shelf. They can't afford ZAR 250K. They could afford ZAR 5K-15K.

**The maths:** 2,000 SME assessments at ZAR 5K = same revenue as 40 enterprise certs at ZAR 250K. Dramatically lower delivery cost. See [[Revenue Architecture#The SME Product in Detail]].

> **📝 My notes:**

### Opportunity 3: Open-Source the Framework

Let the [[Declaration of Algorithmic Rights]] spread freely. Charge for official certification. Open standard, proprietary certification. Like open-source software — code is free, enterprise support is paid.

> **📝 My notes:**
> 

### Opportunity 4: Content as Business Driver

Nobody in SA publishes regular, credible content about AI accountability. Weekly publishing = authority before revenue proves it.

> **📝 My notes:**
> 

### Opportunity 5: The Permanence Positioning

"We certify humans, not machines" means AIC doesn't become obsolete when AI technology changes. You're building a human accountability institution, not an AI governance company. Different lifespan. Different valuation.

## The Conflict of Interest Question

See [[Revenue Architecture#What We Will NOT Do]] for the full analysis.

**Short version:** We assess and certify. We never implement and certify the same work. Arthur Andersen crossed this line. We won't.

**Allowed:** Audit empathy → upsell POPIA *assessment*. Find problems → recommend in report. Refer implementation → take 10-20% referral fee.

**Not allowed:** Rewrite rejection letters AND certify those letters. Build compliance programme AND certify compliance.

## Questions to Answer Before Building

1. **Who is your first paying customer by name?** Not "banks" — a person at a company.
2. **What does the Alpha deliverable look like?** See [[What to Build Now#Build 5 The Mock Alpha Deliverable]].
3. **What's the pricing justification?** ROI case with real numbers.
4. **How do you handle a company that fails?** Determines if AIC is real or pay-to-play.
5. **What's your liability exposure?** Need legal input before first Alpha agreement.
6. **Do you need a co-founder?** Honest assessment.
7. **What's the right word for empathy in the boardroom?** Test in real conversations.

## Revised Sequencing

**Month 1:** Publish [[Declaration of Algorithmic Rights]]. Launch [[AI Governance Index]]. Start content. Begin 20 outreach conversations.

**Month 2:** Build [[What to Build Now#The Empathy Analysis Engine|Empathy Engine]] demo. Enhanced [[What to Build Now#Build 4 Enhanced Self-Assessment Platform|self-assessment]]. Create [[What to Build Now#Build 5 The Mock Alpha Deliverable|mock Alpha report]].

**Month 3:** Sign 3-5 Alpha participants. First [[Evidence Collection Models#Model 1 Document-Based Audit|document-based assessments]]. Info Regulator engagement.

**Month 4-6:** Complete Alpha. Rewrite [[Methodology]]. Launch SME product. Investor materials.

**Month 7-12:** [[What to Build Now#Build 3 The Regulatory Mapper|Regulatory mapper]]. SANAS application. Fundraise. Partner network.
