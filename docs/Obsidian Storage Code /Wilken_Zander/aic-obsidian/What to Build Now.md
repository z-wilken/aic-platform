## The Empathy Analysis Engine
*Priority: HIGHEST | Time: 2-3 weeks | Access needed: NONE*

Single best investor demo piece. Ingests automated communications (rejection letters, denial notices, chatbot transcripts), produces an Empathy Score with diagnostics.

**How to build without clients:** Collect publicly available examples — screenshot rejection emails from job portals, automated denial messages, chatbot conversations. Hundreds exist on social media.

**Scoring Dimensions:**

| Dimension | What It Measures | Weight |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Tone | Respectful and considerate? | 20% |
| Reading Level | Average person understands? (Target: Grade 8) | 10% |
| Human Recourse | Human contact point offered? How accessible? | 20% |
| Impact Acknowledgment | Recognises this matters to the person? | 15% |
| Explanation Clarity | Reason for decision explained? | 15% |
| Next Steps | Clear, actionable next steps? | 10% |
| Response Time | Buffer before decision permanent? | 10% |

**Technical phases:**
- Phase 1: Structured rubric engine (build now)
- Phase 2: NLP-assisted tone/readability analysis (build later)
- Phase 3: Automated scoring + human validation (when funded)

The rubric-based version is the IP — it codifies what "empathetic automated communication" means.

**Demo flow:** Paste rejection letter → Engine analyses → Score: 34/100 → Breakdown → Recommendations → "Here's what 85/100 looks like"

## AI Governance Index Dashboard
*Priority: HIGH | Time: 2-3 weeks | Access needed: NONE (public data)*

Interactive public dashboard scoring JSE Top 40 on AI governance. See [[AI Governance Index]] for full methodology.

**Data sources:** Annual reports, published AI policies, governance disclosures, press releases, job postings.

**Why it matters:** Demonstrates methodology at scale. Creates media content. Pressures companies. Investor can immediately see the market.

## The Regulatory Mapper
*Priority: MEDIUM | Time: 3-4 weeks | Access needed: NONE*

One assessment input → compliance reports for multiple jurisdictions. Proves global scalability.

| Jurisdiction | Regulation | Modules |
|---|---|---|
| South Africa | POPIA Section 71 | Oversight, explanation, challenge |
| EU | EU AI Act | Risk classification, oversight, transparency |
| US | Title VII / ECOA | Bias testing, adverse impact |
| Brazil | LGPD Article 20 | Explanation, human review |

## Enhanced Self-Assessment Platform
*Priority: HIGH | Time: 1-2 weeks*

Upgrade the 20-question quiz. After quiz: evidence upload, detailed gap analysis, PDF report a CRO would use.

**Two tiers:**
- Free: Score + tier + high-level gaps
- Paid (ZAR 5K-15K): Full report + recommendations + compliance mapping + badge

The paid tier IS the SME product. See [[Revenue Architecture#The SME Product in Detail]].

## The Mock Alpha Deliverable
*Priority: CRITICAL | Time: 3-5 days*

20-page sample Integrity Score report for fictional "Acme Financial Services." Cannot sell Alpha without this.

**Contents:** Executive summary, Integrity Score, category breakdown, empathy assessment, bias testing, POPIA mapping, gap analysis, certification decision, methodology appendix.

**Build this before anything else.**

## What NOT to Build Yet

- Full client portal (after 5 paying clients)
- Admin dashboard (after first hire)
- Automated bias engine (need real client data)
- Mobile app (nobody audits AI governance on phones)
- Blockchain anything (no)
