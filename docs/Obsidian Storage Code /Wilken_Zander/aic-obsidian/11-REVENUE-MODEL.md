# Revenue Architecture — Dual-Track Model
*Cross-references: [[10-STRATEGY]] | [[12-EVIDENCE-COLLECTION]] | [[04-CERTIFICATION-FRAMEWORK]] | [[15-LEGAL-ANALYSIS]] | [[00-INDEX]]*

> **The fundamental model:** AIC creates the standard (free, authority-building) and charges for certification against it. Track 1 creates demand. Track 2 captures it. This is structurally identical to how Moody's, LEED, B Corp, and ISO operate.

---

## The Dual-Track Structure

### Track 1 — Standard-Setting (Cost Centre That Creates Revenue)

| Activity | Output | Business Value |
|---|---|---|
| Declaration of Algorithmic Rights | Published framework | Market positioning, academic credibility, policy influence |
| AI Governance Index | Public JSE Top 40 rankings | Media coverage, inbound leads, market pressure |
| Weekly content publishing | Articles, insights, research | SEO, authority, speaking invitations |
| Regulator engagement | Relationship with Information Regulator | Preferred partner status, enforcement signals |
| Methodology white papers | Academic-style papers | Credibility, peer review, citation currency |

**None of this generates direct revenue. All of it creates the conditions for Track 2.**

The counterintuitive truth: organisations do not pay for certification to comply — they pay because their competitors are certified and they aren't. The Index creates that pressure publicly. The more visible the standard, the more valuable the certification.

### Track 2 — Certification Revenue

| Product | Price (ZAR) | Gross Margin | Delivery Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enterprise Certification | 75K–500K | ~65% | Relationship sales, auditor-led |
| Alpha Programme (Year 1) | 50K (reduced) | ~45% | R&D pricing — case studies in return |
| SME Self-Assessment (Paid) | 5K–15K | ~85% | Automated platform, no auditor |
| Annual Renewal | 60% of initial | ~80% | Mostly automated re-assessment |
| Practitioner Training | 35K per trainee | ~70% | Cohort delivery |
| Partner Referral Fees | 10–20% of partner fee | 100% | Network, no delivery cost |
| Insurance Risk Scoring API | TBD (licence) | ~90% | Technology, post-Year 2 |

## Unit Economics

### Enterprise Certification

**Cost to deliver one enterprise assessment (Year 1, Document Review Model):**

| Cost Item | Hours | Rate (ZAR/hr) | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-assessment scoping | 4 | 1,500 | 6,000 |
| Evidence review and analysis | 16 | 1,500 | 24,000 |
| Empathy analysis (3–5 comms) | 4 | 1,500 | 6,000 |
| Bias review (client-provided data) | 8 | 1,500 | 12,000 |
| Report writing | 12 | 1,500 | 18,000 |
| Client debrief and conditions | 3 | 1,500 | 4,500 |
| Admin and platform | — | — | 3,000 |
| **Total delivery cost** | **47 hrs** | | **~73,500** |

**Revenue at Alpha price (ZAR 50K):** Gross loss of ~23,500. This is correct — Year 1 enterprise certs are R&D.
**Revenue at standard price (ZAR 175K):** Gross margin ~58%. Improves as methodology matures and efficiency builds.
**Revenue at premium price (ZAR 350K):** Gross margin ~79%. Achievable for complex multi-system assessments with output testing.

**Break-even point:** 3 enterprise certifications at ZAR 175K each cover 12 months of founder salary at ZAR 50K/month. This is the Year 1 survival threshold.

### SME Self-Assessment (Paid Tier)

**Cost to deliver one SME assessment (automated):**

| Cost Item | Cost (ZAR) |
|---|---|
| Platform hosting (per assessment) | ~50 |
| Claude API (empathy scan, improved version) | ~200 |
| PDF report generation | ~30 |
| Payment processing (Stripe ~2.9%) | ~290 on ZAR 10K |
| Customer support (avg 20 min) | ~500 |
| **Total delivery cost** | **~1,070** |

**Revenue per SME assessment:** ZAR 10,000 (midpoint of ZAR 5K–15K range)
**Gross margin per SME assessment:** ~89%

**The mathematics of scale:**
- 100 SME assessments: ZAR 893,000 gross profit
- 500 SME assessments: ZAR 4,465,000 gross profit
- 2,000 SME assessments: ZAR 17,860,000 gross profit — equivalent to ~72 enterprise certs at ZAR 250K

The SME product is the engine of the business at scale. Enterprise certs are the reputation and cash flow for Year 1–2. SME is the scalable revenue.

## Revenue Scenarios — 5-Year Model

All figures in ZAR thousands. Conservative scenario assumes no co-founder, SA-only market, slower platform development. Optimistic assumes co-founder hired by Month 4, platform SME tier live by Month 6.

### Conservative Scenario

| Revenue Stream | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Alpha Certs (ZAR 50K) | 250 (5×) | — | — | — | — |
| Enterprise Certs (ZAR 175–300K) | — | 2,100 (10×) | 5,250 (20×) | 8,750 (25×) | 13,500 (30×) |
| Enterprise Renewals (60%) | — | 150 | 1,260 | 3,150 | 5,250 |
| SME Assessments (ZAR 10K avg) | 250 (25×) | 1,500 (150×) | 5,000 (500×) | 12,000 (1,200×) | 25,000 (2,500×) |
| SME Renewals (60%) | — | 150 | 900 | 3,000 | 7,200 |
| Practitioner Training | — | 350 (10×) | 875 (25×) | 1,750 (50×) | 3,500 (100×) |
| Partner Referrals | — | 200 | 600 | 1,200 | 2,400 |
| Insurance API (licence) | — | — | 500 | 1,500 | 3,000 |
| **Total Revenue** | **500** | **4,450** | **14,385** | **31,350** | **59,850** |
| **Gross Profit (~75%)** | **375** | **3,338** | **10,789** | **23,513** | **44,888** |

### Optimistic Scenario

| Revenue Stream | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Alpha + Enterprise Certs | 900 (3 alpha + 3 std) | 5,250 (20×) | 12,600 (40×) | 21,000 (50×) | 31,500 (60×) |
| All Renewals | — | 540 | 3,150 | 7,560 | 12,600 |
| SME Assessments | 500 (50×) | 5,000 (500×) | 18,000 (1,800×) | 40,000 (4,000×) | 80,000 (8,000×) |
| SME Renewals | — | 300 | 3,000 | 10,800 | 24,000 |
| Practitioner Training | — | 700 (20×) | 2,100 (60×) | 5,250 (150×) | 10,500 (300×) |
| Partner Referrals + Insurance API | — | 400 | 1,500 | 5,000 | 12,000 |
| **Total Revenue** | **1,400** | **12,190** | **40,350** | **89,610** | **170,600** |
| **Gross Profit (~78%)** | **1,092** | **9,508** | **31,473** | **69,896** | **133,068** |

## Cost Structure

### Year 1 — Solo Founder

| Cost | Monthly (ZAR) | Annual (ZAR) |
|---|---|---|
| Founder salary | 50,000 | 600,000 |
| Legal counsel (engagement) | 15,000 | 180,000 |
| Platform hosting (Vercel, DB, APIs) | 3,000 | 36,000 |
| Claude API (empathy engine) | 2,000 | 24,000 |
| Notion (operational) | 500 | 6,000 |
| Design/brand (once-off, amortised) | 2,500 | 30,000 |
| Travel (client meetings) | 5,000 | 60,000 |
| Accounting + tax | 3,000 | 36,000 |
| Professional Indemnity Insurance | 4,000 | 48,000 |
| Content production | 3,000 | 36,000 |
| Contingency | 5,000 | 60,000 |
| **Total** | **93,000** | **1,116,000** |

**Year 1 break-even revenue: ZAR 1,116,000.** The conservative scenario (ZAR 500K) does not reach break-even. The gap (ZAR ~616K) requires either bridge funding or additional Alpha clients. **Alpha pricing must be reviewed — 5 clients at ZAR 50K = ZAR 250K, not break-even.**

**Revised recommendation:** Price Alpha at ZAR 75K–100K (still discounted from ZAR 175K standard) to approach break-even in Year 1 without bridge funding.

### Year 2 — First Hire (Delivery Contractor or Co-Founder)

Add ZAR 600K–900K for a part-time auditor/delivery lead. This enables 10+ enterprise certs per year. Year 2 conservative total costs: ~ZAR 2.0M against ZAR 4.45M revenue = positive cash flow.

### Year 3 — Small Team (4–5 people)

| Role | Annual Cost (ZAR) |
|---|---|
| Founder (CEO) | 700,000 |
| Lead Auditor / COO | 800,000 |
| Technical Lead (platform) | 900,000 |
| Sales / BD | 700,000 + commission |
| Operations / Admin | 450,000 |
| **Total Headcount** | **~3,550,000** |
| + Operating costs | ~800,000 |
| **Total Costs** | **~4,350,000** |

Year 3 conservative revenue (ZAR 14.4M) against Year 3 costs (ZAR 4.35M) = **ZAR 10M EBITDA** in the conservative case. This is the inflection point.

## Cash Flow Analysis — Year 1 Critical Path

| Month | Revenue Events | Cumulative Cash (ZAR) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | — | -93,000 | Platform, legal setup |
| M2 | — | -186,000 | Building deliverables |
| M3 | Alpha client 1 (ZAR 75K, 50% upfront) | -173,500 | First revenue |
| M4 | Alpha client 2 (ZAR 75K, 50% upfront) | -161,000 | |
| M5 | Alpha client 3 + 10 SME @ ZAR 10K | -56,500 | SME launch |
| M6 | Alpha client 1 completion (50% balance) | +81,000 | First profitable month |
| M7 | 2× enterprise + 20 SME | +338,000 | |
| M8–12 | Standard pipeline | ~+150K/month | Approach break-even |

**The survival condition:** First Alpha client signed by Month 3. This requires the Mock Alpha Deliverable, active outreach, and a compelling demo by Month 2. *(Mock Alpha: DONE. Dashboard: DONE.)*

## Pricing Strategy and Justification

### Why ZAR 75K–175K for Enterprise Is Defensible

The comparable services in the SA market:

| Service | Provider | Typical Cost | What You Get |
|---|---|---|---|
| POPIA compliance audit | Big 4 | ZAR 200K–500K | Legal review, gap analysis, no cert |
| ISO 9001 certification | Bureau Veritas / SGS | ZAR 80K–200K | Management systems cert, no AI focus |
| ESG verification | EY / Deloitte | ZAR 300K–800K | ESG report assurance, no AI coverage |
| B Corp certification | B Lab | ZAR 20K–60K | Self-assessed, limited verification |
| **AIC Enterprise** | **AIC** | **ZAR 75K–500K** | AI-specific, human accountability focus, POPIA-mapped |

AIC is priced between B Corp (too cheap to be credible) and Big 4 compliance (too expensive for most). This is the correct position.

### Why the SME Price (ZAR 5K–15K) Is Correct

The SME buyer (dealership, recruitment agency, estate agent) is paying for:
- A defensible answer to "are you using AI responsibly?"
- A badge for their website and RFP responses
- A risk reduction tool, not a compliance exercise

At ZAR 10K, this is cheaper than a single hour of Big 4 consultation. The self-serve model means there is no delivery cost worth speaking of. The question is not "is ZAR 10K too high?" but "can we acquire SME customers cheaply enough for the unit economics to work?"

**Customer acquisition cost target:** Below ZAR 1,000 per SME customer (10% of revenue). Achievable through: organic content, free Empathy Engine tool as lead magnet, partner channel (law firms, banks recommending to SME clients).

---

## The Renewal Revenue Engine

Certification is not once-off. This is the structural advantage over consulting:

- Enterprise Year 1 cert: ZAR 175K
- Enterprise Year 2 renewal: ZAR 105K (~60%) — less work, same revenue per client relationship
- Enterprise Year 3 renewal: ZAR 105K — nearly pure profit per client

By Year 3, a cohort of 20 enterprise clients from Year 1–2 generates ZAR 2.1M in renewal revenue with minimal incremental delivery cost. This is the SaaS-like recurring revenue that justifies a platform valuation multiple.

## Investor Metrics Summary

For investor conversations, lead with:

| Metric | Year 1 (Conservative) | Year 3 (Conservative) | Year 5 (Conservative) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue | ZAR 500K | ZAR 14.4M | ZAR 59.9M |
| Gross Margin | ~75% | ~75% | ~75% |
| EBITDA | -ZAR 616K | ~ZAR 10M | ~ZAR 40M |
| Enterprise Clients | 5 (Alpha) | 20 | 30 |
| SME Assessments | 25 | 500 | 2,500 |
| ARR (from renewals alone) | — | ZAR 4.4M | ZAR 12.5M |

**TAM framing for investors:**
- SA addressable: ~150 large companies deploying consequential AI × ZAR 250K avg = ZAR 37.5M enterprise + ~50,000 SMEs × ZAR 10K = ZAR 500M SME
- SADC expansion (Year 3+): 3× SA market
- African Continental (Year 5+): 10× SA market
- **Total addressable market (Africa): ZAR 2B+**

## Conflict of Interest — Revenue Model Guardrail

The revenue model must never cross the Arthur Andersen line:

| AIC Does (Revenue) | AIC Does NOT Do (Revenue) |
|---|---|
| Assess and certify AI governance | Implement AI governance improvements |
| Train practitioners to certify others | Provide implementation consulting |
| Licence the methodology | Build AI systems for clients |
| Refer clients to implementation partners (10–20% fee, disclosed) | Accept equity or undisclosed fees from implementation partners |
| Publish the Index | Offer "improved score packages" to Index companies |

**The moment AIC offers to improve someone's score through its own services, the certification is worthless.** This rule must be hardcoded into the business model, the team culture, and the Alpha agreement.
