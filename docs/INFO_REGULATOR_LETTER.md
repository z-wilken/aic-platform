# Letter to the Information Regulator (Draft)

**To:** Advocate Pansy Tlakula (Chairperson of the Information Regulator)
**From:** Zander Wilken, Founder of AI Integrity Certification (AIC)
**Date:** February 2026
**Subject:** Proposal for a Co-regulatory Framework for POPIA Section 71 Compliance

---

**Dear Advocate Tlakula,**

I am writing to introduce you to **AI Integrity Certification (AIC)**, a global accountability framework that we are launching in South Africa because POPIA Section 71 is the most progressive automated decision-making law in the world.

AIC's mission is universal: to certify that no final decision about a human being is made solely by a machine — that human empathy and accountability remain in the loop for every consequential automated decision. We have built our framework on five universal Algorithmic Rights, designed to apply in any jurisdiction and to any automated decision system, not only AI.

We chose South Africa as our first market deliberately. Section 71 of POPIA establishes protections that most countries have not yet recognized in law. South Africa is positioned to be the world's proving ground for algorithmic accountability — and AIC intends to be the vehicle through which this happens.

**The AIC Framework**

AIC has developed a rigorous, three-tier certification framework, underpinned by the 5 Algorithmic Rights and operationalised through our Integrity Score methodology. This framework validates the **Human-in-the-Loop** processes within AI deployments — ensuring that when a system makes a decision affecting human dignity, a human remains accountable, and that the *experience* of being processed by an algorithm preserves that dignity.

We are not a South African company trying to interpret one section of POPIA. We are bringing a global framework to South Africa, using POPIA Section 71 as the legal anchor for our initial market.

**Our Request for Engagement**

We are currently launching our **Alpha Program**, working with 10 leading South African organizations in banking, healthcare, and recruitment to validate our methodology. We would value the opportunity to:

1.  **Present our Methodology:** Share our "Integrity Score" framework and how it maps directly to Section 71 requirements — and to the EU AI Act and other international standards.
2.  **Discuss Co-regulation:** Explore how AIC's private-sector certification can support the Regulator's oversight mission by providing a standardized "proof of accountability" for organizations.
3.  **Seek Guidance:** Ensure our Alpha Program findings are aligned with the Regulator's upcoming guidance on automated decision-making.

South Africa has a unique opportunity to lead the world — not just the continent — in establishing what meaningful human accountability in algorithmic systems looks like. POPIA Section 71 is the legal foundation. AIC is the technical and certification infrastructure. Together, South Africa can demonstrate to the world what responsible algorithmic governance looks like.

I would be honored to host a brief introductory session for your technical or legal teams.

**Yours Sincerely,**

**Zander Wilken**
