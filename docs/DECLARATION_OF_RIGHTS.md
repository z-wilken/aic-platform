# THE DECLARATION OF ALGORITHMIC RIGHTS
**Established:** February 1, 2026
**Guardian:** The AI Integrity Certification (AIC)

## Preamble
We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all humans are endowed with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Dignity. When algorithms are deployed to govern human affairs, they must serve these rights, not erode them.

## The 5 Rights of the Data Subject

### 1. The Right to Human Agency
No final decision affecting a person’s legal status, freedom, or livelihood shall be made solely by a machine. A human being must bear ultimate responsibility.

### 2. The Right to Explanation
Every person has the right to know *why* an algorithmic decision was made. "Black Box" opacity is not a defense; it is a violation.

### 3. The Right to Empathy
Automated interactions must preserve human dignity. Cruelty, dismissal, and cold bureaucratic rejection by algorithms are design failures that must be remediated.

### 4. The Right to Correction
Every system must provide a clear, accessible, and human-staffed mechanism to correct errors and appeal unjust decisions.

### 5. The Right to Truth
A person has the right to know if they are interacting with an artificial intelligence. Deception is a violation of trust.

## Our Pledge
AIC exists to enforce these rights. We verify, we audit, and we certify. We do not serve the algorithm; we serve the human it affects.
