**1. Executive Summary**

AI Integrity Certification (AIC) is a purpose-built third-party
certification body that validates whether organisations deploying
artificial intelligence maintain genuine human accountability over
algorithmic decisions. AIC does not regulate AI technology itself --- it
certifies the people, processes, and governance structures that surround
it.

South Africa\'s POPIA Section 71 explicitly prohibits automated
decision-making without human oversight. Yet 82% of Fortune 500
companies using AI-powered systems lack any governance certification.
Globally, AI discrimination lawsuits have escalated from theoretical to
litigated --- Mobley v. Workday was certified as a class action in May
2025, and the first EEOC settlement resulted in a USD 365,000 penalty.
The market is not hypothetical. The risk is real. The law is clear.

AIC\'s solution is a three-tier accountability framework that maps
certification requirements directly to the stakes of the decisions being
made. Tier 1 covers critical, irreversible decisions where humans must
approve every outcome. Tier 2 covers consequential but reversible
decisions where AI can execute under human supervision. Tier 3 covers
low-stakes, routine decisions where AI operates autonomously under
periodic monitoring. This pragmatic tiering separates AIC from generic
AI governance standards like ISO 42001.

This PRD defines the complete product --- both the marketing website
that launches first and the full platform ecosystem that follows. Phase
1 (the website) is an information and lead-generation engine designed to
convert enterprise prospects into Alpha Program participants. But this
document does not stop there. It maps the full trajectory: the SaaS
monitoring platform, the client certification portal, the insurance
integration layer, the SADC regional expansion, and the long-term vision
of AIC becoming the trust infrastructure for AI deployment across
Africa.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  This document is intentionally forward-looking. Phase 1 builds the
  foundation. Nothing in this PRD should be read as limiting what AIC
  becomes.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**2. Vision & Mission**

**2.1 Vision**

To become the definitive trust infrastructure for AI deployment across
Africa --- the standard that organisations, regulators, insurers, and
the public rely on to know that human beings remain accountable for
every consequential decision an algorithm makes.

**2.2 Mission**

To provide rigorous, third-party certification that organisations
deploying AI in high-stakes decisions maintain genuine human oversight,
can explain their algorithmic outcomes, and bear real accountability for
the consequences.

**2.3 Core Belief**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  We are not afraid of AI. We hold accountable those who wield it
  irresponsibly. Certification does not restrict technology --- it
  enforces human responsibility for algorithmic consequences.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**3. Market Context & Opportunity**

**3.1 The Problem Is Proven, Litigated, and Escalating**

AI accountability is no longer a future concern. It is a present legal,
financial, and reputational risk that organisations are actively facing
today. The following cases and research establish the market reality
that AIC exists to address:

**Legal Precedent**

-   Mobley v. Workday (2023--2025): Certified as class action by US
    District Court (Northern California) in May 2025. Federal judge
    ruled AI vendors can be held liable as \"agents\" of employers under
    Title VII. EEOC filed amicus brief supporting plaintiffs.
    Establishes that AI discrimination is employer liability, not just a
    technology bug.

-   EEOC v. iTutorGroup (2024): First-ever AI discrimination settlement.
    USD 365,000 penalty. AI hiring tool automatically rejected female
    applicants over 55 and male applicants over 60 --- bias learned from
    historical data, applied at scale.

-   SafeRent Housing Discrimination (2024): Tenant screening AI led to
    disproportionate housing denials for Black and Hispanic applicants.
    Court rejected the defence that SafeRent bore no liability because
    it did not make \"final\" decisions. Advisory roles do not shield
    from liability.

-   Sirius XM Radio (Filed August 2025): AI hiring tool discrimination
    lawsuit seeking class action status and injunctive relief. Pattern
    is accelerating.

**Academic Research**

-   University of Washington (2024): AI resume screening favoured
    white-associated names in 85.1% of cases. In some comparisons, Black
    male candidates were disadvantaged 100% of the time.

-   Lehigh University: AI loan approval systems showed white applicants
    8.5% more likely to be approved than Black applicants with identical
    financial profiles.

-   Urban Institute (2024): Black and Brown borrowers more than 2x as
    likely to be denied loans via AI-assisted systems.

-   UC Berkeley (2022): African American and Latinx borrowers charged an
    extra 5 basis points --- costing USD 450 million per year in
    aggregate across the sector.

**3.2 The South African Regulatory Environment**

South Africa is uniquely positioned --- and uniquely exposed --- in
Africa\'s AI landscape. It is among only 15% of African countries with a
formal AI policy framework, and its data protection law already contains
provisions that directly mandate human oversight of automated decisions.

**POPIA Section 71 --- The Legal Foundation**

-   Section 71(1) explicitly prohibits decisions based \"solely on
    automated processing\" that produce legal effects or significantly
    affect data subjects.

-   Organisations must provide mechanisms for human review of automated
    decisions.

-   The Information Regulator has enforcement authority to issue
    compliance notices.

-   682 of 982 POPIA complaints resolved in 2023/2024 fiscal year --- a
    76% year-over-year increase.

-   The DeepSeek breach in early 2025 demonstrated that even a single
    employee inputting data into a public AI model can constitute a
    POPIA violation. The boundary between \"using AI\" and \"deploying
    AI\" is now razor-thin.

**National AI Policy Framework (October 2024)**

-   First formal AI governance framework in South Africa, emphasising
    bias mitigation, fairness, and accountability.

-   Formal AI Act expected within 18--24 months. When it arrives,
    organisations without certification infrastructure will scramble.

-   By April 2025, 22 African Union member states received technical
    assistance for AI strategy. South Africa leads.

**3.3 The Certification Market Is Proven and Profitable**

AIC is not inventing a new business model. Certification is one of the
most durable, high-margin business models in the world. AIC is applying
a proven model to an underserved vertical.

**4. User Personas**

AIC serves multiple distinct audiences across the website and platform.
Each persona has different motivations, decision-making authority, and
points of entry. Understanding these personas shapes every content,
design, and conversion decision.

**4.1 Primary Personas --- Decision Makers**

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Sarah Nkosi** \| Chief Risk Officer                                 |
|                                                                       |
| **Mid-tier Commercial Bank (Johannesburg)**                           |
|                                                                       |
| **Pain Point:** Her bank uses AI for credit scoring on 40,000+        |
| applications monthly. The Mobley lawsuit landed on her radar last     |
| quarter. She knows POPIA Section 71 applies but has no third-party    |
| validation that her oversight processes actually meet the standard.   |
| If a discrimination claim lands, she personally bears reputational    |
| exposure.                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| **Goal:** Obtain independent, third-party proof that the bank\'s AI   |
| credit decisioning maintains genuine human accountability. Something  |
| she can present to the board, insurers, and regulators.               |
|                                                                       |
| **What triggers action:** Reading about the Mobley v. Workday ruling. |
| A competitor obtaining certification. An insurer asking about AI      |
| governance during a premium review.                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| **David Cele** \| Chief Compliance Officer                            |
|                                                                       |
| **Private Hospital Group (Cape Town)**                                |
|                                                                       |
| **Pain Point:** The hospital group deployed AI-assisted radiology     |
| analysis 18 months ago. Radiologists still make final calls, but      |
| David has no formal documentation proving that human oversight is     |
| genuine and consistent across all facilities. A patient complaint     |
| about misdiagnosis is sitting in legal.                               |
|                                                                       |
| **Goal:** Establish a defensible, auditable framework proving that AI |
| in clinical settings operates under human control at every decision   |
| point. Protect the group from liability.                              |
|                                                                       |
| **What triggers action:** The patient complaint. A board member       |
| asking \"Are we covered?\" A conversation with the liability insurer  |
| about AI risk.                                                        |

|                                                                       |
| **National Recruitment Platform**                                     |
|                                                                       |
| **Pain Point:** His platform\'s AI screening tool processes 200,000+  |
| resumes annually. Post-Workday, corporate clients are starting to ask |
| whether his tool can demonstrate non-discrimination. He has no proof. |
| He also has no internal capability to produce it.                     |
|                                                                       |
| **Goal:** Achieve a credible third-party certification that he can    |
| present to enterprise clients as proof of fairness. Turn              |
| accountability into a sales differentiator.                           |
|                                                                       |
| **What triggers action:** A major corporate client asking for bias    |
| testing results during a contract negotiation. Reading about the      |
| Workday case in a LinkedIn post.                                      |

**4.2 Secondary Personas --- Influencers & Researchers**

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Nomvula Shabalala** \| Senior Compliance Analyst                    |
|                                                                       |
| **Same bank as Sarah Nkosi**                                          |
|                                                                       |
| **Pain Point:** She is the person who will actually execute the       |
| certification process day-to-day. She needs to understand what\'s     |
| involved, how long it takes, what evidence is required, and what the  |
| audit looks like --- before Sarah commits budget.                     |
|                                                                       |
| **Goal:** Evaluate whether AIC certification is feasible for the bank |
| given current AI systems, documentation, and team capacity. Build the |
| business case internally.                                             |
|                                                                       |
| **What triggers action:** Searching for \"POPIA Section 71 AI         |
| compliance\" on Google. Finding a blog post or guide that explains    |
| the process clearly.                                                  |

| **Pain Point:** He studies AI governance frameworks in the African    |
| context. He wants to understand what practical accountability looks   |
| like --- not theory, but implementation. He is also a potential       |
| endorser and connector.                                               |
|                                                                       |
| **Goal:** Understand how AIC\'s tier framework translates real-world  |
| AI use cases into accountability requirements. Evaluate whether the   |
| methodology is rigorous enough to publish about or endorse.           |
|                                                                       |

**6.2 Technical Architecture --- Designed for the Full Vision**

The website launches as a static site with minimal backend dependencies.
But every architectural decision is made with the full platform in mind.
We do not want to rebuild when Phase 2 arrives --- we want to connect.

  ---------------- --------------------- -------------------- ---------------

**6.3 API Strategy**

The website is architected as a consumer of APIs --- not a monolith.
This is deliberate. When the backend is built, the website simply
connects to it. The frontend never needs to know whether a form
submission goes to Netlify Forms or to api.aic.co.za. This separation is
the gold standard for this type of product.

**Phase 1 API Surface (External Services)**

-   Contact Form Submission → Netlify Forms or FormSpree (zero backend)

-   Email Capture → Mailchimp or SendGrid (marketing automation)

-   Analytics → Google Analytics 4 (behavioural tracking)

-   Font Loading → Google Fonts CDN (performance)

**Phase 2 API Surface (Proprietary --- Stubbed Now)**

-   POST /api/leads --- Submit contact form or Alpha application

-   POST /api/assessment --- Save self-assessment responses and generate
    report

-   GET /api/certifications/{id} --- Retrieve certification status
    (client portal)

-   POST /api/pulse/health-check --- Submit AI system health data for
    monitoring

-   GET /api/insurance/discount-status --- Check insurance discount
    eligibility

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Every form and interactive element on the Phase 1 website is built to
  POST to a configurable endpoint. When the API is ready, a single
  environment variable change connects the full backend. No frontend code
  changes required.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**7. The Tier Framework --- Core Product Logic**

The three-tier accountability framework is the intellectual heart of
AIC. It is what differentiates AIC from every other AI governance
offering. It must be communicated clearly, demonstrated concretely, and
understood intuitively by both technical and non-technical audiences.
This section defines the framework in full --- not just for the website,
but for the entire product.

|   | or cannot be easily reversed must be reviewed and explicitly        |
|   | approved by a qualified human before it takes effect. The AI may    |

**7.1 Multi-Tier Organisations**

Most real organisations operate across multiple tiers simultaneously. A
hospital group uses Tier 1 for treatment decisions, Tier 2 for patient
triage, and Tier 3 for appointment scheduling. AIC certification maps to
the organisation\'s actual AI portfolio --- not a single tier applied
uniformly.

**8. Phase 1: Website Functional Requirements**

The website is AIC\'s first product --- and its primary lead generation
engine. Every page serves a dual purpose: educate the visitor about AI
accountability, and move them closer to becoming an Alpha Program
participant or certification client.

AIC\'s visual identity is a high-end **\"Gallery/Minimalist\"** aesthetic --- inspired by boutique architecture and design firms. It communicates sophistication, precision, and institutional trust through generous whitespace and smooth motion.

**Colour Palette**

  ----------------- -------------- ---------------------------------------
  **Name**          **Hex Code**   **Usage**

  Deep Charcoal     #121212        Primary text, headlines, core UI
                                   elements

  Gallery White     #FAF9F6        Backgrounds --- warm, soft cream for a
                                   premium feel

  Heritage Red      #C41E3A        Tier 1 signals, critical alerts,
                                   heritage accents

  Metallic Gold     #D4AF37        Highlights, certification badges,
                                   procedural precision

  Soft Gray         #6B7280        Secondary text, captions, placeholders

  Subtle Border     rgba(18,18,18,0.08) Dividers and glass edges
  ----------------- -------------- ---------------------------------------

**Typography**

  -------------- -------------------- -------------- ----------------------
  **Role**       **Font Family**      **Weights**    **Rationale**

  Display        Crimson Pro (serif)  400, 500       Heritage authority.
                                                     Used for key headlines
                                                     and pull quotes.

  Body / UI      IBM Plex Mono        400, 600       Technical precision.
                 (monospace)                         Used for all data,
                                                     labels, and narrative
                                                     copy.
  -------------- -------------------- -------------- ----------------------

**Design Principles**

-   **Precision over Decoration:** Every line and element has a
    procedural purpose.

-   **Generous Whitespace:** Content is given significant room to
    breathe, signalling premium positioning.

-   **Motion as Meaning:** Framer Motion integrated for scroll-triggered
    reveals and staggered entry, making the framework feel alive and
    responsive.

-   **Glassmorphism Lite:** Subtle backdrop blurs on navigation and
    cards to create depth without visual clutter.

**10.2 Component Library**

All UI is built from a consistent component library. Components are
reusable, accessible, and styled through the design system. No one-off
styling.

  --------------- ------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Component**   **Variants**        **Key Behaviours**

**11. Third-Party Integrations & Service Dependencies**

The website is designed to be lightweight at launch --- using proven
third-party services for non-core functions --- while maintaining the
ability to replace every integration with proprietary solutions as the
platform scales.

  --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ---------------

**12. Future State Vision**

This section is deliberately expansive. Phase 1 builds the foundation.
This section defines the ceiling --- everything AIC can and should
become. Every architectural decision in Phase 1 is made with this future
state in mind.

**12.1 AIC Pulse --- The Continuous Monitoring Platform**

Certification is a point-in-time audit. But AI systems drift. Bias can
emerge between audits. AIC Pulse is the SaaS product that turns one-time
certification into ongoing governance --- and creates a recurring
revenue stream.

-   Real-time AI model monitoring: detects bias drift, performance
    degradation, and decision distribution shifts

-   Monthly governance health reports delivered to CRO/CCO dashboards

-   Integration layer: connects to existing AI tools (Credo AI, Fiddler,
    Arthur AI) as data sources

-   Automated alerts when Integrity Score drops below threshold

-   Pricing: ZAR 5,000-15,000/month per certified organisation (based on
    number of AI systems monitored)

-   Revenue model: certified organisations opt into Pulse at
    certification. Renewal rate expected 90%+

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  AIC Pulse transforms AIC from a certification body (one-time revenue)
  into a governance platform (recurring revenue). This is the primary
  path to the ZAR 400-600M implied valuation at Year 5.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**12.2 The Client Portal**

Certified organisations need a secure, authenticated space to manage
their certification lifecycle --- upload evidence, track audit progress,
view Integrity Scores, manage renewals, and access monitoring
dashboards.

-   Authentication: secure login for authorised users at each certified
    organisation

-   Dashboard: real-time view of certification status, Integrity Score,
    upcoming audit dates

-   Evidence Upload: secure document management for audit evidence
    submission

-   Audit Tracker: visibility into audit scheduling, progress, and
    findings

-   Renewal Management: automated reminders, renewal workflow, renewal
    pricing

-   AIC Pulse Integration: monitoring dashboard embedded in the portal

-   Marketing Assets: downloadable certification badges, tender language
    templates, case study summaries

**12.3 Insurance Integration Layer**

One of AIC\'s most powerful value propositions is the financial
incentive: certified organisations should pay less for liability
insurance covering AI-related discrimination claims. This requires a
direct integration layer between AIC and insurance partners.

-   API-based certification status verification: insurers can confirm
    AIC certification in real-time

-   Automated premium discount application: when an organisation
    certifies, their insurer is notified

-   Risk scoring integration: AIC\'s Integrity Score feeds into
    actuarial models

-   Partners: iTOO, Santam, Old Mutual, Discovery (initial targets)

-   Revenue share: AIC takes a referral fee or integration fee from
    insurance partners

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The insurance integration is the mechanism that transforms
  certification from \"nice to have\" to \"financially incentivised
  must-have.\" An 18% premium reduction on AI liability coverage pays for
  certification many times over.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**12.4 SADC Regional Expansion**

South Africa is the beachhead. But the SADC region --- 15 countries, 380
million people --- represents the long-term market. SADCAS (SADC
Accreditation Service) mutual recognition arrangements mean a
SANAS-accredited certification can be recognised across the region.

-   Country-specific regulatory mapping: each SADC country\'s data
    protection law mapped to AIC tiers

-   Multi-language support: English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa, Portuguese
    (Mozambique), French (DRC)

-   Regional pricing: adjusted for local market conditions

-   Partnership with SADCAS: mutual recognition agreement for
    cross-border certification validity

-   Pan-African positioning: \"South Africa\'s AI accountability
    standard, recognised across Africa\"

**12.5 Lead Auditor Training Programme**

AIC can only scale if it has enough qualified auditors. Training is both
a talent pipeline and a revenue stream.

-   Online + in-person training curriculum: AI governance fundamentals,
    POPIA Section 71 interpretation, AIC audit methodology, bias testing
    techniques

-   Certification: graduates receive \"AIC Certified Lead Auditor\"
    designation

-   Pricing: ZAR 35,000 per trainee (based on ISO Lead Auditor training
    market benchmarks)

-   Pipeline: target 50+ certified lead auditors within 3 years

-   University partnerships: embed AIC training in computer science and
    law curricula

**12.6 Government & Tender Integration**

The most durable demand driver is mandate. When government procurement
requires AI certification for public contracts, certification becomes
non-negotiable for any organisation wanting government business.

-   Advocacy: work with National Treasury and department procurement
    teams to include AI certification in RFP templates

-   Tender language: provide ready-to-use certification requirement
    clauses for procurement documents

-   Public sector certification: offer tailored programmes for
    government agencies deploying AI

-   Timeline: target first tender requirement within 24 months of launch

**12.7 Mobile Application**

As AIC Pulse matures, a mobile app becomes natural --- allowing CROs and
compliance officers to monitor AI governance health on the go.

-   iOS and Android apps using the same API as the web platform

-   Push notifications for: bias drift alerts, audit reminders,
    Integrity Score changes

-   Dashboard view optimised for mobile

-   Timeline: Phase 3+ (after Pulse platform is established)

**13. Competitive Positioning**

Every product decision --- content, feature, pricing, messaging --- must
be informed by where AIC sits relative to alternatives. This competitive
map is not just analysis. It is a strategic constraint on every
requirement.

**18. Frontend System Architecture**

This section defines every layer of the frontend system --- how
components are organised, how data flows, how state is managed, and how
the self-assessment engine works under the hood. Everything here is
designed to scale cleanly into Phase 2 without architectural surgery.

**18.1 Architecture Overview**

The frontend is a Next.js application using the Pages Router. It renders
as static HTML at build time (Static Site Generation) for maximum SEO
and performance, with client-side interactivity layered on top via React
components. There is no server-side rendering of dynamic data in Phase 1
--- all content is either static or generated client-side.

  ----------- ------------------ -----------------------------------------
  **Layer**   **Technology**     **Responsibility**

  Page Layer  Next.js Pages      Route definitions. One file per URL.
              (pages/)           Composes layout and page-specific
                                 components.

  Layout      Layout.js          Consistent chrome around every page.
  Layer       (Header + Footer)  Navigation state. Mobile menu.

  Component   Reusable           All UI primitives and composed sections.
  Layer       components         Stateless where possible.
              (components/)      

  State Layer React useState /   Local component state only in Phase 1.
              useEffect          Quiz progress, form state, menu toggle.

  Style Layer Tailwind CSS +     Design system tokens, utility classes,
              globals.css        component classes. Single source of truth
                                 for all styling.

  Data Layer  Static JSON        Quiz questions, blog posts, tier content.
              files +            No API calls in Phase 1.
              client-side logic  

  Service     Form submission    Abstraction over POST endpoints. Swap URL
  Layer       functions          = swap backend. No frontend changes.

  Analytics   Google Analytics 4 Event tracking, pageviews, conversion
  Layer       via custom hook    funnel measurement.
  ----------- ------------------ -----------------------------------------

**18.2 File System & Code Organisation**

Every file lives in exactly one place for a reason. This structure
scales to 50+ pages and 100+ components without becoming unnavigable.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**18.3 Component Architecture**

Components follow atomic design principles. Atoms are the smallest
indivisible units. Molecules compose atoms into functional groups.
Organisms compose molecules into page sections. Pages compose organisms
into full routes. This hierarchy means any component can be reused,
tested, and styled independently.

  ----------- ---------------------- ---------------------------------------
  **Level**   **Examples**           **Rule**

  Atoms       Button, Input,         No internal state. Accept all behaviour
              TierBadge, Label,      via props. Styled purely from design
              Spacer                 system.

  Molecules   FormField (Label +     May have simple local state (hover,
              Input + Error),        focus). Compose 2-4 atoms. One clear
              NavLink, BlogCard      purpose.

  Organisms   HeroSection, TierCard, May fetch data or manage complex state.
              AssessmentQuiz,        Compose molecules into a meaningful
              ContactForm            section.

  Templates   Layout.js              Page structure only. Header + main
                                     content area + Footer. No business
                                     logic.

  Pages       index.js, about.js,    Route entry points. Compose organisms.
              assessment.js          Pass page-specific props. Wire up SEO.
  ----------- ---------------------- ---------------------------------------

**Props Contract Pattern**

Every component documents its props interface as a JSDoc comment block.
This is how AI agents and human developers both understand what a
component expects without reading its implementation.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  /\*\* \* \@param {Object} props \* \@param {string} props.variant -
  \"primary\"\|\"secondary\"\|\"tier-1\"\|\"tier-2\"\|\"tier-3\" \*
  \@param {string} \[props.href\] - If provided, renders as \<Link\>.
  Otherwise \<button\>. \* \@param {Function} \[props.onClick\] - Click
  handler (only when href is not set). \* \@param {React.ReactNode}
  props.children \* \@param {boolean} \[props.fullWidth\] - Stretches to
  fill parent container. \* \@param {string} \[props.className\] -
  Additional Tailwind classes. \*/

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**18.4 State Management Strategy**

Phase 1 uses zero global state. Every piece of state lives in the
component that owns it. This is deliberately simple --- complexity is
added only when the product demands it.

  --------------- -------------- ------------------ -------------------------
  **State Type**  **Location**   **Example**        **Phase 2+ Evolution**

  UI Toggle       useState in    Mobile menu        No change needed.
                  component      open/closed

  --------------- -------------- ------------------ -------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *The pattern is: start with useState. When two sibling components need
  the same state, lift it to their parent. When that becomes unwieldy,
  introduce React Context. Only introduce a global store (Zustand/Redux)
  if Context performance becomes a problem. Do not over-engineer.*

**18.5 Routing & Navigation**

  **Route**             **Type**       **Code Splitting**     **Auth Required**

                        Dynamic        access                 
  --------------------- -------------- ---------------------- -----------------

**Navigation Behaviour**

-   Scroll to top on every route change (implemented in \_app.js via
    router.events).

-   Active nav link highlighted based on current pathname (useRouter
    hook).

-   Mobile menu closes on route change.

-   All internal links use Next.js \<Link\> component for client-side
    navigation (no full page reload).

-   External links (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub) open in new tab with
    rel=\"noopener noreferrer\".

-   404 page: custom branded page with link back to homepage.

**18.6 Form System Architecture**

All forms in the system follow an identical pattern. This means adding a
new form (Alpha application, newsletter signup, partner inquiry)
requires zero new architecture --- just a new form component using the
shared pipeline.

**Submission Pipeline**

  ------------ ----------------------------------- ---------------------------
  **Step**     **What Happens**                    **Error Handling**

  1\. User     User fills form fields. Real-time   Show inline error below the
  Input        validation on blur.                 field. Field border turns
                                                   red.

  2\. Client   On submit: validate all required    Prevent submission. Scroll
  Validation   fields, format checks (email        to first error. Show
               regex), custom rules.               summary at top.

  3\. Honeypot A hidden field must remain empty.   If filled: silently reject
  Check        Bots fill it; humans do not.        (do not tell bot it
                                                   failed).

  4\. Loading  Button shows spinner. Form fields   N/A --- UI feedback only.
  State        disabled. Prevents double-submit.   

  5\. POST     Fetch POST to configured endpoint   Network failure: show retry
  Request      (from config/endpoints.js). JSON    button. Timeout after 10s.
               body.                               

  6\. Success  Replace form with confirmation      N/A --- terminal success
  State        message. Log success event to       state.
               analytics.                          

  7\. Server   If endpoint returns 4xx/5xx: show   Log error to analytics. Do
  Error        generic error with retry option.    not expose server error
                                                   details to user.
  ------------ ----------------------------------- ---------------------------

**Configurable Endpoint Pattern**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  // config/endpoints.js --- single source of truth for all API targets
  export const ENDPOINTS = { contactForm:
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_FORM_URL \|\| \'/api/contact\',
  alphaApplication: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ALPHA_FORM_URL \|\|
  \'/api/alpha\', assessment: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSESSMENT_URL \|\|
  \'/api/assessment\', emailCapture: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_URL
  \|\| \'/api/email\', }; // Phase 1: env vars point to Netlify Forms /
  FormSpree URLs // Phase 2: env vars point to proprietary API
  (api.aic.co.za/v1/\...) // Zero frontend code changes required.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**18.7 Self-Assessment Engine --- Detailed Design**

The self-assessment tool is the highest-complexity frontend system in
Phase 1. It is the primary lead generation mechanism. This section
defines its architecture in full.

**State Machine**

  ----------------- --------------------------- ---------------------------

**Question Data Model**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  // data/questions.js --- each question object { id: \'q01\', category:
  \'AI_USAGE_CONTEXT\', // 4 categories, 5 questions each question: \'How
  many AI-powered decision systems does your organisation currently
  operate?\', options: \[ { value: \'none\', label: \'None --- we are
  evaluating AI adoption\', score: 0 }, { value: \'one\', label: \'1--2
  systems in production\', score: 2 }, { value: \'several\', label:
  \'3--5 systems across departments\', score: 3 }, { value: \'many\',
  label: \'6+ systems, some in critical functions\', score: 4 }, \],
  weight: 1.0, // Relative importance within category (1.0 = standard)
  tier_signal: { // Which tiers this question helps identify tier1:
  \[\'many\'\], tier2: \[\'several\', \'many\'\], tier3: \[\'one\',
  \'several\', \'many\'\] } }

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Scoring Algorithm**

The scoring engine runs entirely client-side in Phase 1. It produces two
outputs: (1) a Tier Recommendation, and (2) an Integrity Score (0--100).

  -------------------- ------------ --------------- ---------------------------------
  **Category**         **Weight**   **Questions**   **What It Measures**

**Tier Determination Logic**

  ---------------------------- ----------------- ------------------------------

                               Tier**            

  Any answer indicates         Tier 1 Audit      High-stakes decisions without

                                                 routine.
  ---------------------------- ----------------- ------------------------------

**18.8 PDF Report Generation**

Full assessment reports are generated as branded PDFs client-side using
jsPDF. This avoids a backend dependency for Phase 1 while producing a
professional deliverable.

  ----------------- -------------------------- --------------------------
  **Report          **Content**                **Source**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Phase 2 upgrade: move PDF generation server-side (Puppeteer rendering
  a styled HTML template). Server-side generation produces
  higher-fidelity output, supports complex charts, and enables cached
  report delivery. The client-side approach in Phase 1 is a pragmatic MVP
  --- good enough to validate the product, replaceable when the backend
  exists.*

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**18.9 Analytics Architecture**

Analytics is wired through a custom React hook that abstracts Google
Analytics 4. This means if we ever switch analytics providers, we change
one file --- not every component.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  // utils/analytics.js export function trackEvent(eventName, parameters
  = {}) { if (typeof window === \'undefined\') return; // SSR guard if
  (!window.gtag) return; // GA not loaded guard window.gtag(\'event\',
  eventName, { event_category: parameters.category \|\| \'General\',
  event_label: parameters.label \|\| \'\', value: parameters.value \|\|
  0, \...parameters }); } // Usage in any component: // import {
  trackEvent } from \'@/utils/analytics\'; //
  trackEvent(\'assessment_started\', { category: \'Assessment\' });

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -------------------- ---------------------- ----------------------------

**18.12 Frontend Security**

-   No API keys, tokens, or secrets exist in frontend code. All secrets
    are server-side environment variables prefixed NEXT_PUBLIC\_ only if
    they are safe to expose (e.g., GA Measurement ID).

-   All user input is sanitised before display. React auto-escapes JSX
    expressions, preventing XSS by default.

-   Content Security Policy (CSP) headers restrict script sources to
    self and Google (Fonts + Analytics only).

-   Cookie consent banner implemented before any tracking cookies are
    set. POPIA-compliant: user must opt in before GA fires.

-   Form honeypot field is a visually hidden input that must remain
    empty. CSS hides it; screen readers skip it via aria-hidden.

-   Sensitive form data (email, company name) is transmitted over HTTPS
    only. Never logged to browser console.

**19. Backend System Architecture**

The backend does not exist in Phase 1. The website launches as a pure
frontend product. This section defines the complete backend system that
connects in Phase 2 --- architected now so that every frontend decision
is compatible. Nothing here is speculative: each system maps directly to
a frontend capability that currently uses a third-party workaround.

**19.1 Architecture Decision: Start Monolithic, Decompose Later**

The backend launches as a single monolithic API service. This is
deliberate. Microservices add operational complexity (service discovery,
distributed tracing, independent deployments) that is unjustified at
AIC\'s scale in Phase 2. The monolith is organised into clearly bounded
modules --- Lead Management, Assessment, Certification, Pulse --- that
can be extracted into independent services when traffic and team size
demand it.

  ------------------ ---------------------- ------------------------------
  **Module**         **Extracts To (Phase   **Trigger for Extraction**

  Monitoring                                independent scaling (WebSocket

**19.4 Database Schema**

The schema is designed around AIC\'s core entities: organisations that
deploy AI, the leads that become those organisations, the assessments
that qualify them, and the certifications that validate them. Every
table has created_at and updated_at timestamps. Every mutation is logged
to audit_logs.

**Supporting Tables**

  -------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  **Table**            **Purpose**

  audit_logs           Append-only log of every data mutation. Stores:
                       user_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, before/after
                       snapshot, timestamp. Required for POPIA compliance
                       and certification audit trail.

  notifications        Every notification sent or queued. Stores: user_id,
                       type, channel (email/in-app), template, status,
                       sent_at. Enables delivery tracking and retry.

  insurance_partners   Configuration for each insurance integration. Stores:
                       partner name, API credentials, webhook URLs, discount
                       rules, active status.

  blog_posts           Blog content for Phase 2+ CMS. Stores: slug, title,
                       body (markdown), author, tags, published_at,
                       seo_description. Phase 1 uses static files; this
                       table enables dynamic CMS.
  -------------------- -----------------------------------------------------

**19.5 Authentication & Authorisation**

**Phase 1: No Authentication**

The website is fully public. No login, no session, no token. All forms
POST anonymously.

**Phase 2: JWT-Based Authentication**

  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  **Flow Step**     **What Happens**

  1\. Login Request User submits email + password to POST /v1/auth/login.
                    Or OAuth via LinkedIn/Google.

  2\. Credential    Server verifies credentials against users table
  Verification      (password hashed with bcrypt, cost factor 12).

  3\. Token         Server issues: access token (JWT, 15-minute expiry) +
  Issuance          refresh token (opaque, 30-day expiry, stored in
                    httpOnly cookie).

  4\. Authenticated Client sends access token in Authorization: Bearer
  Request           header. Server validates signature and expiry.

  5\. Token Refresh When access token expires, client sends refresh token
                    (via cookie). Server issues new access token if
                    refresh token is valid.

  6\. Logout        Server invalidates refresh token (adds to blocklist
                    in Redis). Client clears local tokens.

**19.6 Lead Management Service**

Every form submission on the website creates a lead. The lead management
system captures, scores, enriches, and routes these leads to the sales
process.

  --------------------------- ------------ ----------------------------------

**19.7 Assessment Service**

In Phase 2, the scoring engine moves server-side. This ensures
consistency (no client-side tampering), enables ML-based scoring
improvements, and allows server-side PDF generation with higher
fidelity.

  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  **Responsibility**   **Implementation**

  Response Ingestion   POST /v1/assessments receives all 20 answers as a
                       JSON array. Validates question IDs and answer
                       values against the authoritative question schema.

  Server-Side Scoring  Same algorithm as Phase 1 client-side
                       (utils/scoring.js) but runs on server. Single
                       source of truth. Results stored in assessments
                       table.

  Report Generation    Puppeteer renders a styled HTML template with the
                       results data. Outputs branded PDF. Stored in S3.
                       Link returned to client.

  Lead Creation        On email capture, assessment service creates a
                       lead record and triggers the enrichment + scoring
                       pipeline.

  Caching              Assessment results cached in Redis for 24 hours.
                       Subsequent GET requests return cached result.
                       Avoids recalculation.

  Analytics Emission   Assessment service emits events to an internal
                       analytics bus on completion. Enables server-side
                       funnel analysis independent of client-side GA.

**19.8 Certification Workflow Engine**

The certification workflow is the core business logic of AIC. It manages
the entire journey from application to certified status, including
evidence management, auditor assignment, finding tracking, and renewal
scheduling.

**Workflow State Machine**

  ------------------- ------------------------- --------------------------

**Notification Triggers**

-   Application submitted → confirmation email to applicant + internal
    notification to AIC team.

-   Application approved → email with audit timeline and evidence upload
    instructions.

-   Audit scheduled → calendar invitation + pre-audit checklist.

-   Findings issued → email with finding details and corrective action
    deadline.

-   Certification granted → congratulations email with certificate
    attachment + marketing asset kit.

-   Renewal 90 days out → reminder email with renewal pricing and
    scheduling link.

-   Certification suspended → immediate notification to organisation
    admin + AIC legal team.

**19.9 AIC Pulse Monitoring Service**

Pulse is the continuous governance monitoring platform. It transforms
one-time certification into ongoing accountability. Certified
organisations integrate their AI systems with Pulse via API, and AIC
monitors for bias drift, performance degradation, and governance gaps
between annual audits.

**Bias Drift Detection**

The core algorithm compares current decision distributions against the
baseline established during certification. Statistical significance
testing (chi-squared) determines whether observed differences exceed
acceptable thresholds.

**19.10 Insurance Integration Service**

Insurance integration is the financial incentive layer. When an
organisation achieves AIC certification, their liability insurer is
notified, and premium adjustments are applied. This service manages the
API layer between AIC and insurance partners.

  ----------------- ------------------ ----------------------------------

**Notification Reliability**

-   All notifications are queued via BullMQ before sending. If the send
    fails, the job retries with exponential backoff (1s, 5s, 30s, 5min).

-   After 3 failed retries, the job moves to a dead letter queue. An
    alert fires to the AIC operations team.

-   Every notification record is stored in the notifications table with

**19.13 Background Job Queue**

BullMQ (Redis-backed) processes all asynchronous work. Jobs are defined
with priority levels, retry policies, and timeout limits. The queue is
monitored via a dashboard (Bull Monitor or equivalent).

**19.15 Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation**

AIC serves multiple organisations simultaneously. Data isolation is
critical: Organisation A must never see Organisation B\'s certification
data, evidence, or Pulse metrics. This is enforced at multiple layers.

  -------------- --------------------------------- ----------------------------
  **Layer**      **Mechanism**                     **What It Prevents**

  API Layer      Every authenticated request       User from Org A cannot
                 extracts organisation_id from     access Org B\'s endpoints
                 JWT. All queries automatically    even if they guess the ID.
                 scoped to that organisation.      

  Database Layer PostgreSQL Row-Level Security     Even if application code has
                 (RLS) policies on all             a bug, RLS prevents
                 organisation-scoped tables.       cross-organisation data
                                                   leakage.

  File Storage   S3 path includes organisation_id  Direct S3 access without

                 write) logged with                breach is suspected.
                 organisation_id and user_id.      
  -------------- --------------------------------- ----------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Shared content (blog posts, public tier framework, FAQ) is
  organisation-independent and served without auth. Only
  organisation-specific data (certifications, evidence, Pulse, portal)
  requires tenant isolation.*

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**19.16 Security Architecture**

**Input & Data Security**

-   All API inputs validated using Zod schemas before any business logic
    runs. Invalid requests rejected at the middleware layer with a 400
    response.

-   Prisma ORM uses parameterised queries exclusively. SQL injection is
    structurally impossible.

-   Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12). Never stored in
    plaintext or logged.

-   All API responses stripped of internal fields (database IDs,
    internal status codes) before returning to client.

**Secret Management**

-   Phase 2: environment variables managed via hosting platform
    (Railway/Render). Never in source code.

-   Phase 3: HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for dynamic secret
    rotation.

-   API keys for third-party services (SendGrid, S3, enrichment API)
    rotated quarterly.

**POPIA Compliance**

-   Data retention policy enforced via scheduled jobs: assessment data
    deleted after 3 years unless legal hold. Lead data deleted after 2
    years if not converted.

-   Right to Erasure: DELETE /v1/users/:id/data endpoint. Cascades
    across all tables. Audit log entry preserved (legal requirement) but
    personal data nullified.

-   Cookie consent tracked per user. Analytics events suppressed if
    consent not given.

-   Data Processing Agreement (DPA) template available for enterprise
    clients.

**19.17 Observability & Monitoring**

  ------------------ ----------------- ----------------------------------
  **Capability**     **Tool**          **What It Monitors**

  Structured Logging Pino (Node.js)    All request/response cycles,
                                       errors, business events. JSON
                                       format for log aggregation.

  Error Tracking     Sentry            Unhandled exceptions, API errors,
                                       frontend errors. Grouped by error
                                       type. Alerting on new error types.

  Performance        Datadog or New    API response times (p50, p95,
  Monitoring         Relic             p99). Database query performance.
                                       Queue depth and processing time.

  Health Checks      Custom endpoint:  Returns DB connection status,
                     GET /v1/health    Redis status, queue status. Used
                                       by load balancers for routing.

  Uptime Monitoring  Statuspage or     External HTTP check every 60
                     UptimeRobot       seconds. Alerts on downtime.
                                       Public status page for clients.
