## ~~February 15, 2026 Progress Update~~ SUPERSEDED BY FEB 17 AUDIT

> **⚠️ CRITICAL:** The Feb 15 assessment was overly optimistic. A 360-degree audit on Feb 17 revealed critical security gaps. See corrected status below.

### Platform Status (Corrected Feb 17, 2026)

| Asset | Feb 15 Claim | Feb 17 Actual | Issue |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Marketing Website | 95% | 95% | — |
| Self-Assessment Quiz | 100% | 100% | — |
| Audit Engine (Python) | 85% | **70%** | OOM risk, 40+ sync endpoints |
| Client Platform | 60% | **40%** | 9 RLS bypasses, MFA missing (now fixed) |
| Admin Dashboard | 50% | **35%** | Incomplete |
| Documentation | 90% | **95%** | Updated with accurate status |
| Test Infrastructure | 268 tests | 268 tests | Tests don't catch RLS issues |
| CI/CD Pipeline | 3 workflows | 3 workflows | ✅ Working |
| Shared Packages | 11 | **6 active** | 5 are dead code |

### Technical Status (Corrected)

| Achievement | Feb 15 Status | Feb 17 Corrected |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Automated Testing | ✅ | ⚠️ Tests exist but miss security issues |
| CI/CD Enforcement | ✅ | ✅ Working |
| Engine Integration | ✅ | ⚠️ Circuit breaker works, sync endpoints block |
| Tenant Isolation | ✅ | ❌ **9 RLS bypass endpoints** |
| Real-Time Dashboard | ✅ | ⚠️ UI works, data isolation incomplete |
| Shared Packages | ✅ 11 | ⚠️ 5 dead: events, sockets, middleware, reports, api-client |
| MFA | ❌ | ✅ Implemented Feb 17 |
| Account Lockout | ❌ | ✅ Implemented Feb 17 |
| Token Revocation | ❌ | ✅ Implemented Feb 17 |

### Revised "Ready For" Status (Feb 17)

**Ready For (After Phase 0-1 Security Fixes):**
- Alpha Program outreach (after Week 4)
- Initial audits with contract support
- SANAS research and consultation
- Live platform demos (after RLS fixes)

**NOT Ready For:**
- Production deployment (12-16 weeks remediation needed)
- Scaled operations (engine async conversion needed)
- Investment raise (Series A target: Q3 2026)
- Unsupervised Alpha pilots

### Stage 1 Progress (Revised)

| Activity | Feb 15 Status | Feb 17 Corrected |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Framework Finalization | 🟡 In progress | 🟡 In progress |
| Prospect Outreach | ⬜ Not started | ⬜ Blocked by security fixes |
| Institutional Relationships | ⬜ Not started | ⬜ Not started |
| Platform Technical Readiness | ✅ Near-complete | ❌ **40% - Security F grade** |

### Security Blockers (NEW - Feb 17)

| Blocker | Severity | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| No MFA | CRITICAL | ✅ Fixed Feb 17 |
| Credentials in git | CRITICAL | 🔴 Needs purging |
| 9 RLS bypass endpoints | CRITICAL | 🔴 8 remaining |
| Engine OOM risk | HIGH | 🟡 Cache TTL added |
| 40+ sync endpoints | HIGH | 🔴 Async conversion needed |
| Engine not integrated | High | ✅ Resolved |
| Hardcoded fallback data | High | ✅ Resolved |

### Remaining Engineering Blockers

| Blocker | Priority | Action Required |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| `@aic/db` lint errors | High | Fix 4 `any` types |
| 51 remaining `any` types | Medium | Gradual removal |
| Staging environment | Medium | Vercel preview setup |

### Adjusted Timeline Assessment

The platform technical readiness has accelerated. Key observations:
- **Engineering foundation**: 70-80% complete (was 40%)
- **Business/regulatory foundation**: 10% complete (unchanged)
- **Alpha readiness**: Technical prerequisites largely met; awaiting business execution

The primary gap is now **business execution** (company registration, SANAS consultation, Alpha outreach) rather than technical capability.
