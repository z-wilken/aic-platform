**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**The Problem (Validated):**

-   • In May 2025, the Mobley v. Workday class action lawsuit was
    > certified by a US federal court, establishing legal precedent that
    > AI vendors can be liable for algorithmic discrimination

-   • First EEOC settlement in 2024: tutoring company paid USD 365,000
    > for AI hiring tool that automatically rejected applicants over age
    > 55

-   • University of Washington study (2024): AI resume screening favored
    > white-associated names in 85.1% of cases

-   • Lehigh University research: AI loan approval systems showed white
    > applicants were 8.5% more likely to be approved than Black
    > applicants with identical financial profiles

-   • 492 of Fortune 500 companies now use AI-powered applicant tracking
    > systems, yet only 18% have any AI governance certification

-   • South African Information Regulator resolved 682 of 982 POPIA
    > complaints in 2023/2024 fiscal year - a 76% year-over-year
    > increase in complaints

**The Market Opportunity:**

-   • Global ISO certification market: USD 16.14 billion (2024),
    > projected to reach USD 66.25 billion by 2034 (CAGR 15.2%)

-   • South Africa released National AI Policy Framework in October
    > 2024, positioning itself as 1 of only 15% of African countries
    > with formal AI policy

-   • POPIA Section 71 explicitly prohibits automated decision-making
    > without human oversight - creating legal mandate for certification

-   • SANAS (SA National Accreditation System) has accredited 1,960
    > conformity assessment bodies as of 2022, proving robust
    > certification ecosystem exists

-   • Manufacturing sector (38% of ISO market) + Financial Services
    > (20%+ of governance market) = immediate total addressable market

**Our Solution:** AIC provides third-party certification of AI
accountability frameworks under POPIA Section 71 compliance. We are NOT
regulating AI technology - we are certifying that **humans remain
accountable** for AI deployment in high-stakes decisions.

**Investment Request:** ZAR 10 million for 25% equity

**Use of Funds (Validated Against Comparable Certification
Businesses):**

> **Personnel (40%):** ZAR 4.0M - 2 Lead Auditors (ZAR 1.2M each), 1
> Technical Director, 1 Operations Manager, 1 Business Development
>
> **SANAS Accreditation (5%):** ZAR 500K - Application, assessment,
> witness audits, and compliance infrastructure
>
> **Technology Platform (25%):** ZAR 2.5M - AIC Pulse monitoring SaaS,
> certification management system, client portal
>
> **Market Development (20%):** ZAR 2.0M - Alpha program partnerships,
> regulatory advocacy, industry awareness
>
> **Working Capital (10%):** ZAR 1.0M - 6-month runway buffer for
> operational expenses

**SECTION 1: MARKET VALIDATION**

**1.1 AI Discrimination is a Proven, Litigated Problem** (Not
Hypothetical)

> **Mobley v. Workday (2023-2025):** Certified as class action lawsuit
> by US District Court (Northern District of California) in May 2025.
> Plaintiff alleges Workday AI screening tool discriminated against
> applicants based on race, age, and disability. Federal judge ruled
> that AI vendors can be held liable as \"agents\" of employers under
> Title VII. EEOC filed amicus brief supporting plaintiffs. Case
> ongoing.
>
> **EEOC v. iTutorGroup (2024):** First AI discrimination settlement in
> history. Company paid USD 365,000 after AI system automatically
> rejected female applicants over 55 and male applicants over 60. AI
> learned bias from historical hiring data and applied it at scale to
> thousands of applications.
>
> **SafeRent Housing Discrimination (2024):** Tenant screening AI tool
> based on credit scores led to disproportionate housing denials for
> Black and Hispanic applicants. Court allowed case to proceed,
> rejecting argument that SafeRent had no liability because it did not
> make \"final\" decisions.
>
> **Sirius XM Radio (Filed August 2025):** Job applicant sued claiming
> AI hiring tool discriminated based on race by perpetuating historical
> biases. Case seeks class action status and injunctive relief requiring
> modification or discontinuation of AI system.

**Academic Research Confirms Systemic Bias:**

-   • University of Washington (2024): AI models preferred
    > white-associated names in 85% of resume screenings; in some cases,
    > Black male candidates were disadvantaged in 100% of comparisons

-   • Lehigh University mortgage study: AI chatbots recommended loan
    > denials for more Black applicants than white applicants with
    > identical financial profiles. White applicants were 8.5% more
    > likely to be approved.

-   • Urban Institute analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data
    > (2024): Black and Brown borrowers were more than 2x as likely to
    > be denied loans

-   • UC Berkeley study on fintech lending (2022): African American and
    > Latinx borrowers charged an extra 5 basis points in interest
    > rates - costing USD 450 million per year in aggregate

**1.2 South African Regulatory Environment**

**POPIA Section 71 - The Legal Foundation:**

-   • Section 71(1) explicitly prohibits decisions based \"solely on
    > automated processing\" that produce legal effects or significantly
    > affect data subjects

-   • Organizations must provide mechanisms for human review of
    > automated decisions

-   • The Information Regulator has enforcement authority to issue
    > compliance notices

-   • 682 of 982 POPIA complaints were resolved in 2023/2024 fiscal year
    > (up from 616 in prior year)

-   • DeepSeek breach in early 2025 exposed how POPIA applies to AI
    > systems - single employee inputting data into public AI model can
    > constitute POPIA violation

**National AI Policy Framework (Released October 2024):**

-   • Department of Communications and Digital Technologies released
    > first formal AI governance framework

-   • Emphasizes bias mitigation, fairness, and accountability as
    > foundational principles

-   • South Africa is among only 15% of African countries with formal AI
    > policy (per OECD)

-   • Framework explicitly acknowledges AI systems trained on historical
    > data may reflect past discriminatory practices

-   • Public consultation process completed November 2024 - formal AI
    > Act expected within 18-24 months

-   • By April 2025, 22 African Union member states received technical
    > assistance for AI strategy development

**1.3 Certification is a Proven, Profitable Business Model**

**Global ISO Certification Market Data:**

-   • Market size: USD 16.14 billion (2024) → USD 66.25 billion (2034)

-   • CAGR: 15.2% annually

-   • Manufacturing sector: 38% of market share

-   • Healthcare: Fastest-growing segment (driven by quality and safety
    > requirements)

-   • Over 1.7 million organizations in 160+ countries hold ISO
    > certifications

-   • Major players: Bureau Veritas, SGS, DNV GL, BSI, Intertek
    > (multi-billion dollar global companies)

-   • Average certification costs: USD 10K-50K for SMEs, USD 50K-200K
    > for large enterprises

-   • Renewal rates: 85%+ (certification becomes operational
    > requirement, not optional)

**South African Certification Infrastructure:**

-   • SANAS (South African National Accreditation System) is sole
    > national accreditation body

-   • Founded 1996, operates under Department of Trade, Industry &
    > Competition

-   • Accredits certification bodies to ISO/IEC 17021 standard

-   • As of 2022: 1,960 accredited conformity assessment bodies in South
    > Africa

-   • SANAS is signatory to IAF (International Accreditation Forum) and
    > ILAC (International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation) mutual
    > recognition arrangements

-   • Accreditation is for 3-year term with annual surveillance audits

-   • International recognition enables South African certifications to
    > be accepted globally

**SECTION 2: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**

**2.1 Current Players in AI Governance/Certification Space:**

> **ISO/IEC 42001 (AI Management System):** Global standard released
> 2023. Focuses on organizational AI management systems, not specific
> decision accountability. Gap: Does not certify human oversight of
> individual AI decisions. Does not map to POPIA Section 71
> requirements.
>
> **Big 4 Consultancies (Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, EY):** Offer AI ethics
> consulting, risk assessments, and advisory services. Gap: Consulting,
> not certification. No accredited third-party stamp. Clients cannot
> display \"certified\" status to customers. No ongoing monitoring.
>
> **AI Auditing Startups (e.g., Credo AI, Fiddler AI):** Technical bias
> detection and model monitoring platforms. Gap: Software tools, not
> certification frameworks. No human accountability verification.
> US/EU-focused, limited African presence.
>
> **Existing ISO Certification Bodies (Bureau Veritas, SGS, etc.):**
> Could extend into AI certification but have not. Gap: No AI-specific
> methodology. Generic ISO 42001 does not address POPIA Section 71
> granularity. Opportunity for first-mover with purpose-built framework.

**2.2 AIC Competitive Advantages:**

-   • POPIA-Native: Framework explicitly designed for Section 71
    > compliance (automated decision-making oversight)

-   • Tier System: Pragmatic approach that allows AI use while enforcing
    > human accountability where consequences are severe

-   • First-Mover in South Africa: No SANAS-accredited AI-specific
    > certification body exists today

-   • Regional Positioning: South Africa is AI policy leader in Africa -
    > certification framework can scale to SADC region via SADCAS (SADC
    > Accreditation Service)

-   • Human Accountability Focus: Differentiated positioning vs. \"AI
    > ethics\" - we certify people, not machines

-   • Regulatory Timing: National AI Act expected within 18-24 months -
    > certification readiness positions AIC as compliance solution

**SECTION 3: UNIT ECONOMICS & FINANCIAL MODEL**

**3.1 Certification Pricing (Based on ISO Market Benchmarks):**

> **Small Organizations (\<50 employees):** Initial Certification: ZAR
> 120,000 \| Annual Renewal: ZAR 60,000 \| Audit Days: 2-3

    > (63% margin)

-   • Medium Org: ZAR 240K revenue - ZAR 80K COGS = ZAR 160K gross
    > profit (67% margin)

-   • Large Org: ZAR 360K revenue - ZAR 128K COGS = ZAR 232K gross
    > profit (64% margin)

-   • Blended Gross Margin Target: 65% (in line with certification
    > industry standards)

**3.3 Customer Acquisition Economics:**

**SECTION 5: RISK FACTORS & MITIGATION**

> **Regulatory Risk: AI Act Not Passed:** Mitigation: POPIA Section 71
> already provides legal foundation. Certification addresses existing
> compliance need, not hypothetical future regulation.
>
> **Competitive Risk: Big 4 Enter Market:** Mitigation: First-mover
> advantage with SANAS accreditation (14-month lead time). Purpose-built
> methodology vs. generic consulting. Focus on certification, not
> advisory.
>
> **Market Risk: Low Demand:** Mitigation: Pilot program validates
> willingness to pay before scaling. Insurance partnerships create
> financial incentive (premium discounts). Tender requirements create
> mandate.
>
> **Execution Risk: SANAS Accreditation Delayed:** Mitigation: Alpha
> program revenue during accreditation period. Experienced certification
> professionals on founding team. SANAS process well-documented.
>
> **Talent Risk: Auditor Shortage:** Mitigation: Partner with
> universities for Lead Auditor training programs (ZAR 35K revenue per
> trainee). Recruit from existing ISO auditor pool.

**SECTION 6: INVESTMENT THESIS**

**Why Now? Why South Africa? Why This Team?**

> **Timing is Perfect:** AI discrimination lawsuits are happening NOW
> (Mobley, iTutorGroup, SafeRent). POPIA Section 71 provides legal
> mandate. National AI Act coming within 18-24 months. First-to-market
> captures regulatory tailwinds.
>
> **Market is Proven:** ISO certification is USD 16B+ global market
> growing 15% annually. Certification business model has 85%+ renewal
> rates and 65%+ gross margins. South Africa has robust accreditation
> infrastructure via SANAS.
>
> **Differentiated Positioning:** We do NOT sell \"AI ethics
> consulting\". We certify human accountability in AI deployment. Clear
> tier system (Human-Decisive, Human-Supervised, Automated-Permissible)
> provides pragmatic framework vs. vague ethics principles.
>
> **Regional Leadership:** South Africa is among only 15% of African
> countries with formal AI policy. SANAS accreditation enables expansion
> to SADC region (15 countries, 380M people) via SADCAS mutual
> recognition.
>
> **Exit Opportunity:** Big 4 consultancies, global certification bodies
> (Bureau Veritas, SGS), and AI governance startups are actively
> acquiring niche certification capabilities. AI governance sector
> seeing 25x revenue multiples in late-stage rounds.

**INVESTMENT ASK**

**We are seeking ZAR 10 million in exchange for 25% equity.** This
capital will fund:

-   • Recruitment of 2 experienced Lead Auditors (ZAR 1.2M annual each)

-   • SANAS accreditation process (ZAR 500K including assessments and
    > witness audits)

-   • Development of AIC Pulse monitoring platform (ZAR 2.5M)

-   • Alpha program with 10 early-adopter organizations to validate
    > framework

-   • Regulatory advocacy to position AIC as Section 71 compliance
    > solution

-   • 18-month runway to break-even (Month 18, Q2 Year 2)

*This is not a bet on whether AI discrimination will become a problem.
It already is. This is a bet on South Africa leading Africa in building
trust infrastructure for the AI economy.*
