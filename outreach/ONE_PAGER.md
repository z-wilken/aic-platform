# AIC: AI Integrity Certification
**The Accountability Layer for South African AI**

---

## 🎯 The Problem
**POPIA Section 71** prohibits automated decisions that have legal or substantial effects on citizens unless there is "meaningful human intervention." Yet, for most organizations, "meaningful" remains a vague legal term rather than a technical specification. This creates massive legal, financial, and reputational exposure.

## 💡 The Solution
AIC is a third-party certification body that validates **human accountability** in AI deployment. We don't just audit code; we certify the people, processes, and governance structures that ensure a human remains responsible for every consequential algorithmic outcome.

## 📊 The 3-Tier Framework
We map accountability requirements to the stakes of the decision:

*   **Tier 1: Human-Approved (Critical Risk)**
    *   *Usage:* Cancer diagnosis, parole decisions, major loans.
    *   *Requirement:* 100% human review before any decision takes effect.
*   **Tier 2: Human-Supervised (Elevated Risk)**
    *   *Usage:* Consumer credit, resume screening, insurance underwriting.
    *   *Requirement:* Real-time override capability + quarterly bias auditing.
*   **Tier 3: Automated (Standard Risk)**
    *   *Usage:* Product recommendations, spam filtering.
    *   *Requirement:* Clear user disclosure + semi-annual monitoring.
