# Letter to the Information Regulator (Draft)

**To:** Advocate Pansy Tlakula (Chairperson of the Information Regulator)
**From:** Zander Wilken, Founder of AI Integrity Certification (AIC)
**Date:** February 2026
**Subject:** Proposal for a Co-regulatory Framework for POPIA Section 71 Compliance

---

**Dear Advocate Tlakula,**

I am writing to introduce you to **AI Integrity Certification (AIC)**, a South African-born initiative dedicated to solving one of the most pressing challenges in our digital economy: the accountability gap in automated decision-making.

As you are aware, **Section 71 of the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA)** establishes a critical right for data subjects—the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing which results in legal consequences or substantial impact. However, for many South African organizations, the practical implementation of "meaningful human intervention" remains undefined.

**The AIC Mission**

AIC has developed a rigorous, three-tier certification framework that validates the **Human-in-the-Loop** processes within AI deployments. Our mission is to ensure that when a system makes a decision affecting human dignity, a human remains accountable.

**Our Request for Engagement**

We are currently launching our **Alpha Program**, working with 10 leading South African organizations in banking, healthcare, and recruitment to test and refine our accountability metrics. We would value the opportunity to:

1.  **Present our Methodology:** Share our "Integrity Score" framework and how it maps directly to Section 71 requirements.
2.  **Discuss Co-regulation:** Explore how AIC’s private-sector certification can support the Regulator’s oversight mission by providing a standardized "proof of accountability" for organizations.
3.  **Seek Guidance:** Ensure our Alpha Program findings are aligned with the Regulator’s upcoming guidance on automated decision-making.

South Africa has a unique opportunity to lead the continent in ethical AI governance by grounding technology in constitutional values. We believe AIC can be a vital tool in your office's effort to protect the rights of South Africans in the age of automation.

I would be honored to host a brief introductory session for your technical or legal teams.

**Yours Sincerely,**

**Zander Wilken**
Founder, AI Integrity Certification (AIC)
