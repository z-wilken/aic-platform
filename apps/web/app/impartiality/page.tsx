              AI Integrity Certification (Pty) Ltd (&ldquo;AIC&rdquo;) is committed to impartiality in all
              its certification activities. Impartiality means that AIC&apos;s certification decisions
              are based solely on objective evidence, assessed by competent and independent
              personnel, and are not influenced by commercial, financial, or personal interests.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              AIC will not allow commercial pressure, applicant relationships, or external
              influences to compromise the integrity of any assessment or certification decision.
              This commitment applies to all directors, employees, contractors, and auditors
              acting on behalf of AIC.
